To change the brake fluid, you will need to follow these steps: 

 

1. Locate the brake fluid reservoir in your vehicle. It is usually a clear plastic container with MAX and MIN markings on it. 

 

2. Use a turkey baster or a brake fluid pump to remove the old brake fluid from the reservoir. Be careful not to spill any brake fluid on the car's paint as it can damage the finish. 

 

3. Once the old fluid is removed, clean the reservoir with a lint-free cloth to ensure there is no contamination. 

 

4. Refill the reservoir with new brake fluid that is recommended for your specific vehicle. Make sure to use the type of brake fluid specified in your owner's manual. 

 

5. Slowly pour the new brake fluid into the reservoir up to the MAX marking. Avoid overfilling. 

 

6. After filling the reservoir, you may need to bleed the brake system to remove any air bubbles. This process may vary depending on your vehicle, so it's best to consult your owner's manual or a professional mechanic for guidance. 

 

7. Once the brake fluid is changed and the system is bled, check for any leaks or issues before driving the vehicle. 

 

Remember, if you are not comfortable or experienced with changing brake fluid, it is recommended to have this task done by a professional mechanic. Brake fluid is a critical component of your vehicle's braking system, and proper maintenance is essential for your safety on the road.
