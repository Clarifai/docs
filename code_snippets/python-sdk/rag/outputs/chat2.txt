 After following the steps to drain, flush, and pressure test the cooling system as described in the text, the next procedure would be to check for any leaks in the cooling system. This can be done by inspecting the entire cooling system, including the radiator, hoses, water pump, and heater core, for any signs of leaks. If there is less pressure on the gauge after the pressure test, there is probably a leak. Additionally, the engine should be started and the temperature gauge should be monitored to ensure that the cooling system is functioning properly. If the engine overheats or the temperature gauge reads high, further diagnosis and repair may be necessary.
