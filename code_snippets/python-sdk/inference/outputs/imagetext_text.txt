The time of day in the image appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the light in the sky. It's not possible to determine the exact time without additional context, but the sky has a mix of light and dark hues, which typically occurs during sunrise or sunset. The presence of snow and the lighting at the train station suggest that it might be winter, and depending on the location, this could influence whether it's morning or evening.
