(content=" Here's a poem I wrote about history:\n\nThe Tides of Time\n\nThe tides of time ebb and flow,\nCarrying stories of long ago.\nFigures and events 
come into light,\nShaping the future with all their might.\n\nKingdoms rise, empires fall, \nLeaving traces that echo down every hall.\nRevolutions bring change with a fiery glow,\nToppling structures from long ago.\n\nExplorers traverse each ocean and
land,\nSeeking treasures they don't understand.\nWhile artists and writers try to make their mark,\nHoping their works shine bright in the dark.\n\nThe cycle repeats again and again,\nAs humanity struggles to learn from its pain.\nThough the players may change on history's stage,\nThe themes stay the same from age to age.\n\nWar and peace, life and death,\nLove and strife with every breath.\nThe tides of time continue their dance,\nAs we join in, by luck or by chance.\n\nSo we study the past to light the way forward, \nHeeding warnings from stories told and heard.\nThe future unfolds from this unending flow -\nWhere the tides of time ultimately go.", role='assistant'))], created=1713896579, model='https://api.clarifai.com/v2/users/anthropic/apps/completion/models/claude-2_1/outputs', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=Usage(prompt_tokens=12, completion_tokens=232, total_tokens=244))
