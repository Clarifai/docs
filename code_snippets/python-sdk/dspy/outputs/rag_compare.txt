According to the context information provided, the potential risks associated with large language models (LLMs) are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that there are risks associated with LLMs, and these risks are considered particularly important given their widespread use. Additionally, the context information highlights the importance of detecting, measuring, and mitigating biases in LLMs to prevent associated harms. It also mentions that a better understanding of bias metrics can help researchers better adapt and deploy LLMs. For more specific risks, one might need to refer to the cited source (Bender et al., 2021).
