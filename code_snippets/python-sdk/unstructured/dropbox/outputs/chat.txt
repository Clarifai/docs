'Brake fluid is a type of hydraulic fluid used in hydraulic brake and hydraulic clutch applications in vehicles. 
It is responsible for transferring force into pressure, and to amplify braking force. 
The level of brake fluid in a vehicle can be checked via a clear reservoir, and it should ideally be between the minimum and maximum level marks. If the fluid is low, it could indicate a potential issue and might require a visit to a mechanic. Most vehicles also have a dashboard light that illuminates when the brake fluid is low.'
