"The Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP) is a platform designed, developed, and hosted by the National Informatics Centre in association with the Department of Expenditure. Its main goal is to ensure transparency in public procurement processes. The portal provides a single access point to information on procurements made across various Ministries and Departments. It contains features like e-publishing and e-procurement modules and it's mandatory for all Ministries/Departments of the Central Government and other entities to publish their tender enquiries and information about the resulting contracts on the CPPP. The portal provides access to documents related to pre-qualification, Biddersâ€™ enlistment, Bidding documents, and other procurement-related information. It also facilitates e-procurement for Ministries/Departments that do not have large procurement volumes or only require procurement for day-to-day operations."
