    string_value: "**Photosynthesis** is the natural process by which green plants, algae, and many bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in sugars (carbohydrates). In doing so, they also produce the oxygen we breathe.  \n\n---\n\n## The Basic Idea\n\n| Input (reactants) | Energy source | Output (products) |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **CO₂** (carbon dioxide) | **Sunlight** (photons) | **C₆H₁₂O₆** (glucose) |\n| **H₂O** (water) |  | **O₂** (oxygen) |\n\nThe overall balanced chemical equation is:\n\n\\[\n6\\; \\text{CO}_2 \\;+\\; 6\\; \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\;+\\; \\text{light energy} \\;\\longrightarrow\\; \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 \\;+\\; 6\\; \\text{O}_2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Where It Happens\n\n- **Chloroplasts** – organelles in plant cells (and in algae) that contain the pigment **chlorophyll**.\n- **Thylakoid membranes** – stacked discs inside chloroplasts where the light‑dependent reactions occur.\n- **Stroma** – the fluid surrounding the thylakoids where the Calvin (light‑independent) cycle takes place.\n\n---\n\n## Two Main Stages\n\n### 1. Light‑Dependent Reactions (the “photo” part)\n\n| Step | What happens | Key molecules |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Photon absorption** | Chlorophyll captures light photons. | Excited electrons |\n| **Water splitting (photolysis)** | H₂O → O₂ + H⁺ + e⁻ | Releases O₂ to the atmosphere. |\n| **Electron transport chain** | Excited electrons move through proteins, pumping protons to create a gradient. | Generates ATP (via chemiosmosis) and NADPH (via ferredoxin‑NADP⁺ reductase). |\n\n**Outputs:** ATP (energy currency) and NADPH (reducing power), plus O₂ as a by‑product.\n\n### 2. Light‑Independent Reactions – The Calvin Cycle (also called the “dark” reactions)\n\n| Phase | What happens | Key molecules |\n|-------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Carbon fixation** | CO₂ is attached to a 5‑carbon sugar (ribulose‑1,5‑bisphosphate, RuBP) by the enzyme **Rubisco**, forming a 6‑carbon intermediate that splits into two 3‑carbon molecules (3‑phosphoglycerate, 3‑PGA). | 3‑PGA |\n| **Reduction** | ATP and NADPH from the light reactions convert 3‑PGA into glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate (G3P). | G3P (a sugar‑phosphate) |\n| **Regeneration** | Some G3P molecules are used to regenerate RuBP, allowing the cycle to continue. | RuBP |\n| **Carbohydrate synthesis** | For every 6 CO₂ fixed, 2 G3P exit the cycle; two G3P can be linked to form one glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆). | Glucose (or other carbohydrates) |\n\n**Outputs:** Glucose (or other sugars) that can be stored as starch, used for growth, or broken down for energy; the cycle also consumes the ATP and NADPH produced earlier.\n\n---\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n1. **Primary production** – Photosynthesis is the base of most food webs. All heterotrophic organisms (animals, fungi, most bacteria) ultimately rely on the organic carbon fixed by photosynthesizers.\n2. **Oxygen supply** – The O₂ released is essential for aerobic respiration in most living things.\n3. **Carbon cycle** – It removes CO₂ from the atmosphere, helping regulate Earth’s climate.\n4. **Human uses** – Crops (wheat, rice, corn, etc.) are cultivated for their photosynthetic products; biofuels, bioplastics, and even synthetic photosynthesis research aim to harness this process for sustainable energy.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Summary (in a nutshell)\n\n- **Photosynthesis** = **light energy** + **CO₂** + **H₂O** → **glucose** + **O₂**.  \n- Takes place in chloroplasts, using chlorophyll to capture sunlight.  \n- Consists of **light‑dependent reactions** (make ATP & NADPH, release O₂) and the **Calvin cycle** (use ATP/NADPH to turn CO₂ into sugars).  \n- It fuels the planet’s ecosystems and maintains atmospheric oxygen.\n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like more detail on any part—e.g., the role of specific pigments, variations in algae and cyanobacteria, or how scientists are trying to improve photosynthetic efficiency for agriculture!"
