**Fun fact:** Some plants can “talk” to each other through the air—when they’re stressed (e.g., attacked by insects), they release volatile organic compounds that neighboring plants detect and use to ramp up their own photosynthetic defenses, like producing extra protective pigments. In a sense, they’re sending a chemical SOS to help each other stay green!
