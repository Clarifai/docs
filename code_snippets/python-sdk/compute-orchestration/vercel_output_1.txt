Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy (usually from sunlight) into chemical energy in the form of glucose (sugar). This process is essential for life on Earth as it produces the oxygen we breathe and forms the base of most food chains.

## The Basic Process

**Overall equation:**
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

This means carbon dioxide + water + light energy → glucose + oxygen

## Two Main Stages

1. **Light-dependent reactions** (occur in the thyloids):
   - Chlorophyll absorbs light energy
   - Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen
   - Energy is captured and stored in molecules like ATP

2. **Light-independent reactions/Calvin cycle** (occur in the stroma):
   - Carbon dioxide is "fixed" into organic molecules
   - Glucose is produced using the energy from stage 1

## Why It Matters

- **Produces oxygen**: Nearly all oxygen in our atmosphere comes from photosynthesis
- **Creates food**: Forms the foundation of food webs
- **Removes CO₂**: Helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
- **Stores energy**: Converts solar energy into chemical energy that powers most life on Earth

Photosynthesis primarily takes place in the leaves of plants, specifically in specialized cell structures called chloroplasts, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll.
