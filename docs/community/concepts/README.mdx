# Creating and Managing Concepts

**Connect words to the subjects in your data**
<hr />

Concepts are entities in the world that you want to search over, recognize, annotate, etc. 

For further details, see our concepts API docs [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/concepts/).

## Concept Best Practices

* Avoid special characters and spaces.
* Avoid long concept names. Typically, 1-3 word concepts are best.
