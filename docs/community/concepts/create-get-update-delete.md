**Manage your concepts**
<hr />

A concept is something that describes an entity in the physical world, similar to a “tag” or “keyword.” Concepts are also known as "classes" in the field of machine learning.

You can use a concept to annotate an input if that input has that entity. You can also add it to a model if you want that model to be able to recognize that entity. The data in these concepts give the model something to “observe” about the keyword, and learn from.

Within your app on the Community platform, you can create concepts and carry out various management tasks on them. 

:::caution

We currently do not support deleting concepts unilaterally since they have such an integral tie across almost all other data structures in the platform, like inputs, models, searches, etc.

## Create Concepts

To create a new concept on the Community platform, head to your application's individual page. Then, select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar.

You'll be redirected to the inputs' manager page, where you can create new concepts and use them to complete various operations.

There are several ways to create concepts on the platform. Let's illustrate two of them:

- Via the **Labels** section
- Via the inputs uploader

### Via the **Labels** section

To create a new concept, go to the **Labels** section on the inputs' manager page and click the plus sign (**+**) next to the **Search Labels...** search box. Then, type the new concept name in the search box.

The new name you've typed will appear underneath the search box. Click the **Add new label** button to create the concept.

The new concept will be successfully added to your app. You can follow the same process to create other concepts for your app.

### Via the inputs uploader

You can also create new concepts when uploading inputs to your app. To do so, click the **Upload inputs** button.

The small window that pops up allows you to upload your inputs—either by uploading them directly from your local device or by providing a publicly accessible URL.

If you click the **Show Upload Settings** button, you'll expose a section that allows you to add concepts with your inputs. Under the **Concepts** section, click the plus sign (**+**) next to the **Select concepts** search box. Then, type the new concept name in the search box.

The new name you've typed will appear underneath the search box. Click the **Add new concept** button to create the concept.

The new concept will be successfully added to your app.

You can also click the **Upload inputs** button at the bottom of the pop-up window to finalize uploading your input.
