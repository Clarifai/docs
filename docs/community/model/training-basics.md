# Training Basics

**Train new models with the click of a button**
<hr />

After adding images with concepts, then created a model with those concepts, the next step is to train the model.

When you train a model, you are telling the system to look at all the images with concepts you've provided and learn from them. The train operation is asynchronous. It may take a few seconds for your model to be fully trained and ready.

To train a model, start by navigating to the individual page of your app. Then, select the **App Models** option on the collapsible left sidebar.

You’ll be redirected to the models’ listing page, where you can see a list of models available in your app.

Select the model you like to train. 

On the individual model's page, click the **Train Model** button on the page's upper right-hand corner.

Your model will be trained on all inputs that have been processed. If you're training the model again, a new version of the model will be created.
