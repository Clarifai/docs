# Making Predictions

**Dynamic AI model orchestration and inference scaling**
<hr />

The Community platform analyzes your inputs and tells you what's inside of them. The platform will return a list of concepts with corresponding probabilities of how likely it is these concepts are contained within the provided input.

Predictions are ready the moment you upload an input. Just search for your preferred model on the Community platform and use it to make predictions. 

For example, you can use the pre-built Clarifai's [general-image-recognition](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/general-image-recognition) model to identify a variety of concepts in an image. To do so, navigate to the model's page and click the **Try your own image or video** button to upload an image you want to view its predictions. 

After uploading the image, the model will analyze it and return a list of concepts identified on the right-hand side of the page.
