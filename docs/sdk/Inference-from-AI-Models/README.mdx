# Inference From AI Models

**Learn how to perform model predictions using the Clarifai SDK**
<hr />

You can leverage the Clarifai Python SDK or the Node.js SDK to make accurate predictions on your data. Whether you're working with images, videos, text, or other formats, the SDKs offer an intuitive and efficient way to interact with AI models and perform inferences seamlessly.

For an even simpler approach, Clarifai provides a user-friendly [Command Line Interface](https://docs.clarifai.com/sdk/cli) (CLI), bundled within the Python SDK package. The CLI streamlines inferencing tasks, allowing you to quickly run predictions and view results â€” all without requiring extensive setup.

This combination of tools ensures flexibility and ease of use, empowering you to harness the full potential of Clarifai's AI capabilities.
