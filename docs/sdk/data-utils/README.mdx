**Learn how to use the Clarifai Data Utils library**
<hr />



[Data Utils](https://github.com/Clarifai/clarifai-python-datautils) is an open-source Clarifai library that provides a powerful suite of multimedia data utilities to simplify and accelerate your data management and processing activities.  

This library seamlessly integrates with the Clarifai Python SDK, empowering you to unlock AI-driven solutions for both visual and textual use cases. 

With Data Utils, you can effortlessly extract, transform, and load unstructured data — such as images, videos, and text — into the Clarifai platform.  

The library offers two key features:  

-  **Image Annotation Loader** — This framework enables you to load various annotated image datasets and export them directly to the Clarifai platform. It also supports converting between different annotation formats, ensuring compatibility and flexibility for your projects.  

- **Data Ingestion Pipelines** — Designed for text-based tasks, this framework provides robust pipelines to load text files (e.g., PDF, DOC), transform and chunk the content, and seamlessly ingest it into the Clarifai platform for further processing and analysis.
