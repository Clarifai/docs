# Single Input-Viewer

**View and interact with your input**
<hr />

The single Input-Viewer is the main page that showcases the details of a single input available in your app.

If you click an image listed on the Inputs-Manager page, you'll be redirected to the viewer page for that image, where you can view and interact with it.

You can complete several tasks on the Input-Viewer screen, including:

- Use the assistive tools at the top of the page to manually label your inputs. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/annotate/label-types/). 
- Generate annotations for your inputs automatically using AI-assisted labeling. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/annotate/ai-assist). 
- Use the carousel to swiftly move from one input to another. 
- Click the info button in the lower-left section to see details of the input, such as input ID, creation date, and resolution.
