Next, click the **Select Model or Workflow** search box, and select the model or workflow you want to use from the drop-down list. You can choose your own or an external one from the Community, including Clarifai's models. You can also create your own model or workflow from there.

You can also click the model settings icon to set the prediction threshold for the model. With the slider, you can set the threshold that will allow you to see only the prediction probabilities that meet your defined criteria.
