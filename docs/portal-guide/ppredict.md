# Making Predictions

**Dynamic AI model orchestration and inference scaling**
<hr />

You can use the Clarifai portal to analyze your inputs and understand what's inside of them. The portal will return a list of [concepts](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/concepts/create-get-update-delete) with corresponding probabilities of how likely it is that these concepts are contained within the provided inputs.

Predictions are ready the moment you upload an input. You can make predictions using custom or public models and workflows. You can search for your preferred model on the [Community platform](https://clarifai.com/explore) and use it to make predictions. 

For example, you can use the pre-built Clarifai's [general-image-recognition](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/general-image-recognition) model to identify a variety of concepts in an image. To do so, navigate to the model's page and click the **Try your own image or video** button to upload an image you want to view its predictions. 

After uploading the image, the model will analyze it and return a list of concepts identified on the right-hand side of the page.
