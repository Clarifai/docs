# Teams & Logs Tab

**Gain insights into platform activities with enhanced visibility, security, and governance**
<hr />

The Teams & Logs tab allows you to monitor platform operations by capturing detailed audit logs, helping you track what activities were performed, who performed them, and their outcomes. 

It provides the ability to assess user actions and resource changes, identify potential security issues, maintain comprehensive logs to meet regulatory requirements, and monitor request origins to troubleshoot failed operations effectively.

You can get details of the following activity logs:

- **When** — Timestamp of the operation.  
- **Who** — Identity of the user performing the action.  
- **What** — Description of the operation.  
- **Where** — IP address where the request originated from.  
- **Status** — Success or failure results of the operation.  

By default, the page displays activities across all your apps. You can customize the view by selecting specific app(s) using the dropdown menu in the upper-right corner.

Additionally, you can filter and view data for specific time periods using the date range selector in the upper-right corner. If you click the tool, a calendar will drop down, which allows you to specify a date range to narrow down the activity logs. You can learn more about the tool [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/control-center/#date-ranges).
