# Creating Workflows

**Understand mesh workflows**

<hr />

Mesh workflows is a useful Clarifai's feature that allows you to combine multiple models and carry out different operations on our platform. With workflows, you can create a powerful multi-model system that meets various use cases in a single callâ€”instead of relying only on one model.

Workflows provide a modular architecture for your inference pipeline. They provide the building blocks for advanced machine learning ensemble modeling and business logic.

Use mesh workflows to process complex logic, gain insights, and build targeted solutions. With mesh workflows, you can work with your machine learning models like they are nodes in a graph. 

Clarifai makes it easy to connect together models of different kinds so that you can perform complex operations on your data, and build solutions that target your specific business needs.
