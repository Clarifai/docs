# Workflow Builder

**Easily build custom workflows**
<hr />

The workflow builder is designed to make it easy for you to create, modify, and experiment with AI workflows.
You can create the skeleton of a workflow by connecting one or more models, and then configuring each model-type as a node in your workflow.  

Agent system operators are non-trainable models that can be added to workflows on-the-fly, without the need to pre-configure these models ahead of time. You can even view and edit the output settings of any model in a workflow, directly in the graph editor.

## Building Workflows

To build a workflow, just grab a model from the left-hand sidebar and drag it onto your workspace. This model will automatically be configured as a node in your workflow. Once a node is added to your workflow, you can configure the model parameters in the right-hand sidebar.

The models in your workflow will automatically connect when they are placed near each other. You can also grab the node connectors on each model and configure your workflow nodes manually.
