# Evaluating Models

**Learn about model evaluation tools**
<hr />

Now that you've successfully trained the model, you may want to test its performance before using it in a production environment. 
The model evaluation tool allows you to perform cross-validation on a specified model version. 

Once the evaluation is complete, you can view the various metrics that inform the model’s performance.

## How It Works

Model evaluation performs a K-split cross-validation on data you used to train your custom model.

In the cross-validation process, it will: 

1. Set aside a random 1/K subset of the training data and designate it as a test set;
2. Train a new model with the remaining training data;
3. Pass the test set data through this new model to make predictions;
4. Compare the predictions against the test set’s actual labels;
5. Repeat steps 1\) through 4\) across K splits to average out the evaluation results.

## Requirements

To run the evaluation on your custom model, it should meet the following criteria:

* It should be a custom-trained model version with the following:
  1. At least two concepts;
  2. At least ten training inputs per concept \(at least 50 inputs per concept is recommended\).

:::important Note

The evaluation may result in an error if the model version doesn’t satisfy the requirements above.

## Running Evaluation

You can run the evaluation on a specific version of your custom model on the Community platform. 

To do so, on your application's page, select the **App Models** option on the collapsible left sidebar. On your **Models** listing page, select the model you'd like to evaluate its performance.

You'll be redirected to the individual model's page. Under the **Versions** tab, go to the version of the model you want to evaluate its performance. And under the **ROC** column, click the **Calculate** button, which will start the evaluation process.

The evaluation may take up to 30 minutes. Once it is complete, the **Calculate** button will become a **View Results** button. 

Click the **View Results** button to see the evaluation results.

For more information on how to interpret the evaluation results, check the next [Interpreting Evaluations](../evaluate/interpreting-evaluations/) section.
