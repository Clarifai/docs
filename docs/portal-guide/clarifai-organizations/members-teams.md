# Manage Members and Teams

**Learn how to manage members and teams**

<hr />

Having members and teams within your Clarifai organization enhances productivity, ensures efficient task management, and supports the collaborative development of your machine learning projects.

Let's illustrate how to manage members and teams within your Clarifai organization. 

## How to Add and Manage Members 

To add new members to your organization, start by clicking your organization’s profile icon at the top-right section of the navigation bar. On the drop-down list that follows, select the **Account** option.

You’ll be redirected to your organization’s settings page. 

On the left sidebar, select the **Members** option.

You’ll be redirected to the **Members** page, where you can add new members and carry out various member management tasks. 

To add a new team member to your organization, you need to send them an invitation first. Click the **Invite Member** button to do so.

On the dialog box that appears, enter the invitee’s email address and select a role you wish to assign to them.

You can assign any of the following roles:

- **Team Contributor (select apps)**—the invitee will be available to contribute only to some selected applications.
- **Organization Contributor (all apps)**—the invitee will be able to contribute to all the apps within the organization. 
- **Admin**—the invitee will have administrative privileges in the organization. 

After providing the details, click the **Confirm** button. 

When you send an invitation, the invitee will receive the invitation in their email address for them to decide whether to accept or decline the request. 
If they do not already have an account with Clarifai, they will need to register first before joining your organization. 

You can track the invitations on the **Pending Invitations** section of the page. If you want to rescind any pending invitations, you can also delete them from there.

Every user is currently limited to one organization only. So, a user can only belong to one organization at a time. If you’ve invited an existing Clarifai user who already belongs to another organization, they will need to exit their current one before joining yours.

Once invitees have accepted your invitation, their details will appear under the **Current Members** section of the page. From there, you can search for team members, reassign roles, or delete members.

## How to Add and Manage Teams

Teams allow you to bring different members of your organization together to accomplish specific tasks. For example, you can aggregate users with the same access privileges to certain apps together in a single team.

To add a new team to your organization, start by clicking your organization’s profile icon at the top-right section of the navigation bar. On the drop-down list that follows, select the **Account** option.
