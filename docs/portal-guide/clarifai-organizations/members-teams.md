# Manage Members and Teams

**Learn how to manage members and teams**

<hr />

Having members and teams within your Clarifai organization enhances productivity, ensures efficient task management, and supports the collaborative development of your machine learning projects.

Let's illustrate how to manage members and teams within your Clarifai organization. 

## How to Add and Manage Members 

To add new members to your organization, start by clicking your organization’s profile icon at the upper-right section of the navigation bar. In the drop-down list that follows, select the **Account** option.

<br/>

You’ll be redirected to your organization’s settings page. 

On the left sidebar, select the **Members** option. You’ll be redirected to the **Members** page, where you can add new members and carry out various member management tasks. 

To add a new team member to your organization, you need to send them an invitation first. Click the **Invite Members** button to do so. 

![Organization settings page](/img/clarifai_orgs/organization_settings_page.png)

In the dialog box that appears, enter the invitee’s email address and select a role you wish to assign to them.

![Invite member dialog box](/img/clarifai_orgs/invite_member_dialog_box.png)

You can assign any of the following roles:

- **Team Contributor (select apps)** — the invitee will be available to contribute only to some selected applications.
- **Organization Contributor (all apps)** — the invitee will be able to contribute to all the apps within the organization. 
- **Admin** — the invitee will have administrative privileges in the organization. 
- **Organization User (all apps)** — the invitee will have access privileges similar to those of an Organization Contributor for all apps and scopes. However, the role comes with view-only permissions without create, update, or delete privileges.

[Click here](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/clarifai-organizations/security#scopes-and-access-levels-of-organization-members) to learn more about the scopes and access levels allowed for each user type within a Clarifai organization.

After providing the details, click the **Confirm** button. 

When you send an invitation, the invitee will receive a notification in their email address as well as in the platform's notification bar for them to decide whether to accept or decline the request. If they do not already have an account with Clarifai, they will need to register first before joining your organization. 

You can track the invitations on the **Pending invitations** section of the page. If you want to rescind any pending invitations, you can also delete them from there.

:::warning multi-org membership

We offer a multi-org membership functionality. Users can create, join, and engage with multiple organizations. A user’s membership is not limited to only one organization at any given time. 

:::

Once invitees have accepted your invitation, their details will appear under the **Organization members** section of the table. From there, you can search for team members, reassign roles, or delete members.

## How to Add and Manage Teams

Teams allow you to bring different members of your organization together to accomplish specific tasks. For example, you can aggregate users with the same access privileges to certain apps together in a single team.

To add a new team to your organization, start by clicking your organization’s profile icon at the upper-right section of the navigation bar. In the drop-down list that follows, select the **Account** option — as earlier highlighted. 

You’ll be redirected to your organization’s settings page. 

On the left sidebar, select the **Teams** option. You’ll be redirected to the **Teams** listing page, where you can create new teams and carry out various team management tasks. 

Click the **Create Team** button to add a new team to your organization.

![Organization teams](/img/clarifai_orgs/organization_teams.png)

In the dialog box that appears, enter the team ID, team name, and set default permissions for the team. 

![Create team dialog box](/img/clarifai_orgs/create_team_dialog_box.png)

Click the **Confirm** button.

Your newly created team will appear on the **Teams** listing page. You can search for other teams you've added and delete them on that table.

![Teams listing page](/img/clarifai_orgs/teams_listing_page.png)

If you click on any listed team’s name, you’ll be redirected to its individual page, where you can accomplish several management tasks, including adding and managing team members and apps. 

Let's demonstrate how you can achieve some of the tasks. 

### How to Manage a Team
