# Security 

**Learn how to enhance the security of your Clarifai organization**

<hr />

At Clarifai, we understand that the security of your organization is of utmost importance. We are committed to prioritizing security and have designed our platform to cater to the needs of even the most security-conscious companies. 

Our robust security measures ensure the protection and confidentiality of your valuable data. 

## Scopes and Access Levels of Organization Members

Scopes and access levels play a crucial role in defining the boundaries of the components, resources, or data that members of an organization can access or manipulate. 

Every member of a Clarifai organization—administrator, organization contributor, or team contributor—has their own pre-set scopes that determine what actions they can perform and what resources they can access. 

The permissions allowed for each user type help to protect your organization’s resources from unauthorized infiltration, maintain the privacy of your assets, and ensure trackability of resources by knowing who has access to what. 

Here is a table detailing the scopes and access levels allowed for each user type within a Clarifai organization:

## How to Enforce the Security of Your Clarifai Organization

You can take some additional actions to augment the security of your organization at Clarifai.

To access the security settings of your organization, start by clicking your organization’s profile icon at the top-right section of the navigation bar. On the drop-down list that follows, select the **Security** option.

On the **Security** page, you can view the password policies associated with your organization’s account. You can also create and view identity providers to reinforce the security of your organization. 

For example, if you want to add a security identity provider, such as SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), click the **Create Identity Provider** button.

On the next page, provide its details and click the **Create** button to finalize the process.

SAML is a reliable mechanism that can add to the security of your organization’s account by ensuring authentication and authorization data are securely transferred between parties.
