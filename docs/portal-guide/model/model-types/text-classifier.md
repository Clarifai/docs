# Text Classifier 

**Learn about our text classifier model type**
<hr />

**Input**: Text

**Output**: Concepts

Text classifier is a type of deep fine-tuned model designed to automatically categorize or classify text data into predefined categories or concepts. This is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) and has a wide range of applications, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic categorization, and more. 

:::info

The text classifier model type also comes with various templates that give you the control to choose the specific architecture used by your neural network, as well as define a set of hyperparameters you can use to fine-tune the way your model learns.

::: 

You may choose a text classifier model type in cases where:

- You need an automated way to process and categorize large amounts of textual data, enabling applications that require efficient and accurate text categorization.
- You need a text classification model to learn new features not recognized by the existing Clarifai models. In that case, you may need to "deep fine-tune" your custom model and integrate it directly within your [workflows](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/workflows/).
- You have a custom-tailored dataset, accurate labels, and the expertise and time to fine-tune models.

## Example use case

A company wants to monitor customer sentiment towards its products by analyzing online reviews. They receive a large number of product reviews on their website and social media platforms. To efficiently understand customer opinions, they can employ a text classifier model to automatically classify these reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
