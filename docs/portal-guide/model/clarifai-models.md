# Clarifai Models

**Pre-trained, pre-optimized, and ready to use right out of the box**
<hr />

Our model library is constantly growing and developing. You can browse the [Community](https://clarifai.com/explore) platform to learn more about the available models.

You can also use the [`Get`](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/model/create-get-update-and-delete#get) commands outlined in the API guide to see a list of all the available pre-built models you can use in your app.  

## Clarifai Models

Clarifai Models are "Trainable" machine learning models that have been developed in-house and have been thoroughly tested.

Clarifai Models are ready to make predictions right out of the box. 

For example: 

- Our ["General"](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/general-image-recognition) model recognizes over 11,000 different concepts, including objects, themes, moods, and moreâ€”with outputs in 23 different languages. 
- Our ["Food"](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/food-item-recognition) model recognizes more than 500 food items in images down to the ingredient level. 

Before you train your own model, we suggest trying these out to see if they fit your needs.
