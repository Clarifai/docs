# Clarifai Models

**Pre-trained, pre-optimized, and ready to use right out of the box**
<hr />


Clarifai models are designed to be fast, scalable, and highly flexible, providing the ability to quickly deploy solutions that can adapt to your specific business needs. They can simplify complex tasks, reduce development time, and deliver reliable, accurate results.

Our model library is continually expanding and evolving. You can explore the [Community](https://clarifai.com/explore) platform to find a model that best fits your needs.

:::tip 

You can use the [`Get`](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/model/create-get-update-and-delete#get) commands outlined in our API guide to view a complete list of available pre-built models that you can integrate into your app.

:::

Our models are fully "trainable" machine learning models developed in-house and rigorously tested, ready to make predictions right out of the box. 

We offer models across a wide range of categories, including generative models like large language models (LLMs), as well as classification, detection, and segmentation models.

For example:

- **[General-Image-Recognition](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/general-image-recognition)**: A visual classification model that recognizes over 11,000 concepts — including objects, themes, and moods — with outputs available in 23 languages.
- **[Food-Item-Recognition](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/food-item-recognition)**: A specialized visual classification model that identifies more than 500 food items down to the ingredient level.
