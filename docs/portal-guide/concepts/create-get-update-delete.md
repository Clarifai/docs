# Create, Get, Update, Delete

**Manage your concepts**
<hr />

Within your app, you can create concepts, modify them after creation, and get them from your app.

:::important
We currently do not support deleting concepts since they have such an integral tie across almost all other data structures in the platform, like inputs, models, searches, etc.
:::

You will find that some of our endpoints have additional information returned from the Clarifai/main app, which contains our pre-trained models and a large knowledge graph we've assembled over the years.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Create

### Add Concepts

To create a new concept in the legacy Portal, start by heading to your application's page. Then, either click the "View In Explorer" button or the "eye" icon in the lefthand sidebar.
