# Creating and Managing Concepts

**Connect words to the subjects in your data**
<hr />

A concept in machine learning is a label or tag used to describe an entity, similar to a keyword. It helps annotate data, allowing models to learn from patterns associated with that concept. 

Over time, through training on annotated data, models can recognize or classify new data based on the concepts they've learned. Concepts are often called "classes" in classification tasks.

For further details, see our concepts API docs [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/concepts/).
