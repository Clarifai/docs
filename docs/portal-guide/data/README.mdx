# Your Data

**Manage your inputs and training data on the Community Platform**
<hr />

An input is the data you're providing into the Community platform. You can upload your inputs to be used for data labeling, training new models, performing searches, or making predictions. 

The platform lets you upload images, videos, and texts from URLs or from a local directory.

Your inputs should fulfill the following conditions:

* 128 is the maximum number of images that can be sent at once
* Each image, audio, or text should be less than 20MB
* Each video should be less than 100MB

## Upload Inputs

 To upload inputs, just navigate to your individual app's page and select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar. Then, click the **Upload Inputs** button. 

The small window that pops up allows you to upload any type of input dataâ€”files from your local directory, text, or publicly accessible URL.
