# Annotations

**Add, edit, and understand the annotations on your data**
<hr />

## View all annotations on a given input

The input viewer page is the main page that showcases the details of a single input available in your app. If you click an image listed on the inputs manager page, you'll be redirected to the viewer page for that image, where you can see its annotations. 

Once you're on the input viewer page, ensure the page's mode is set to **Annotate**, which is the default. You can find the mode settings at the top-right corner of the page.

You can view all the annotations on your selected input on that page.

## View the work of individual annotators

You can view an annotation and the annotator who added it by clicking the person icon on a listed annotation field on the right sidebar. An aggregate view window will pop up, and you can review the work of your annotator from here, and resolve any potential conflicts between annotations.

The annotation tab also supports both classification and detection apps.
