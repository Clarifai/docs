# Predictions

**View predictions**
<hr />

The input viewer page is the main page that showcases the details of a single input available in your app. If you click an image listed on the inputs manager page, you'll be redirected to the viewer page for that image, where you can see its predictions. 

Once you're on the input viewer page, set the page's mode to **Predict**. You can find the mode settings at the top-right corner of the page.

On the right sidebar, click the **Select a Model or Workflow** link to view the predictions of your input.

Next, click the **Select Model or Workflow** search box, and select the model or workflow you want to use from the drop-down list. You can choose your own or an external one from the Community, including Clarifai's models. You can also create your own model or workflow from there.

After selecting your preferred model, the predictions will be populated on the right sidebar.

You can also click the model settings icon to set the prediction threshold for the model. With the slider, you can set the threshold that will allow you to see only the prediction probabilities that meet your defined criteria.

If you want to see the predictions from another model, you can click the gear icon at the top rightmost part of the page. Then, you can choose another model from the drop-down list.
