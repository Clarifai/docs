# Tasks

**Manage and delegate your labeling work with tasks**
<hr />

Tasks enable you to delegate labeling jobs of any size to your team. You can create new labeling tasks, delegate these tasks to your workforce, and review their work in one convenient tool.  

Delegating labeling tasks to a team can provide several benefits, including:

**1. Quality control**

Ensuring inputs are labeled correctly and consistently is critical for producing accurate models. By delegating the labeling tasks to a team, you can have multiple sets of eyes looking at the data and reviewing one another's work, which can help improve the accuracy of the exercise.

**2. Flexibility**

Embracing a team approach to labeling can provide more flexibility in terms of workload management. If one team member is unavailable, or if they're unable to complete their assigned tasks within the stipulated time, other team members can take on their responsibilities. This ensures the labeling tasks are completed on schedule. 

**3. Improved productivity**

Annotating inputs can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. It can be challenging to complete the exercise wholly in-house. By delegating the work to a team, you can scale up the exercise quickly, especially as the volume of data increases. 

Distributing the work among team members can assist in speeding up the process and lead to efficient use of resources. 

**4. Expertise**

A team may comprise members with different backgrounds and skills, which can lead to a more comprehensive and accurate labeling process. For example, one team member may have expertise in [visual similarity search](https://www.clarifai.com/use-cases/visual-search), while another may have experience with [content moderation](https://www.clarifai.com/solutions/content-moderation).
