## Search by Predictions

We enable you to discover and retrieve the most relevant images from your dataset by searching for the concepts identified by your AI models. 

Our world-class patented technology gives you the ability to search for predictions immediately after trainingâ€”you do not need to wait for re-indexing. 

You can build recommendation systems with rapid retraining cycles for active learning on the fly.

## Search by Visual Similarity

We enable you to go beyond simple keyword searches. You can quickly draw a direct line from the source of an idea \(an image\), to the information you need. You do not need to guess keywords. 

Similarly, you can combine our Search feature with detection models so that you can search for a specific thing or a region of an image.
