# Combine or Negate

## Negate search criteria

Find all data that is NOT similar to a given criteria. For example, you can search for all the inputs NOT annotated “dog”.

## Combine search criteria

Add together multiple search parameters to expand your search. You can even combine negated search terms for more advanced tasks.

Combining search criteria always uses the "AND" operation. "OR" is not an option.
