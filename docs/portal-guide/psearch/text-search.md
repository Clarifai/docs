# Text Search

**Search your text inputs based on similarity or concepts**
<hr />

## Text Similarity Search

Just like an image-to-image search, Clarifai allows you to use text inputs as parameters for search. Just hover over the text input that you would like to use, and click the magnifying glass icon. 

After performing the search, the results of similar texts will be populated on the page, displaying a list of texts that closely match the input text or query.

## Search Text by Concept

You can search based on concepts by simply typing the name of the concept in the "Smart Search" search bar. The search results will be ranked based on the inputs with the highest predicted values for the given concept.
