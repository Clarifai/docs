# Welcome

**Orchestrate and customize AI workloads on any infrastructure, at the scale you need**
<hr />

Clarifai is the leading hybrid cloud AI orchestration platform, empowering enterprises to build, deploy, and manage AI at scale. Our platform supports AI models built with our end-to-end AI lifecycle stack or your preferred tools, seamlessly integrating community, private, and self-hosted models.

With Clarifai, enterprises can accelerate AI deployment, optimize costs, and run workloads seamlessly across cloud, on-prem, hybrid, and edge environments — all through a unified control plane that ensures governance.

At its core, Clarifai is built on three foundational layers, which are reinforced with military-grade security:

-	**Compute** – Clarifai’s Compute Orchestration powers AI models, enabling costs reduction, fast deployment, scaling, and optimization across diverse environments.
- **Control & Governance** – Our platform offers a unified control plane that provides a single pane of glass to manage your AI resources, monitor performance, track costs, and control usage across all your deployments. It's built to meet industry-leading security and compliance standards — including SOC 2, NISPOM, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and HIPAA.
- **Create & Manage** – Get a comprehensive suite of AI lifecycle tools you need to customize your AI workloads. Auto-label, train, fine-tune, and deploy models with our full AI toolset — backed by world-class AI expertise.

## Compute

- **Deploy AI Anywhere** — Run AI on any hardware, in any cloud, or on-prem, including private VPCs or Clarifai’s managed infrastructure.

- **Cut Costs, Maximize Compute** — Reduce costs with GPU fractioning, auto-scaling, inference streaming, and spot instances for maximum efficiency.

- **Enterprise-Grade Security** — Manage AI with enterprise security, role-based access, and a unified control pane for billions of requests.

- **Accelerate AI to Production** — Streamline model deployment with automated workflows, push-button builds, and simplified scaling.

## Unified Control and Governance

- **AI Operations & Performance** — Gain real-time insights into model activity, search operations, and system performance to optimize efficiency.

- **Cost & Resource Monitoring** — Track AI resource usage and expenses across deployments. Optimize costs, prevent overages, and maintain efficient allocation.

- **Activity & Change Logs** — Monitor all user actions with time-stamped logs. Track workflow updates, application changes, and system events for full transparency.

- **User Roles & Access Control** — Manage permissions for AI resources with role-based access. Control who can create, update, or delete applications, models, and clusters.

## Create and Manage

- **Automated Data Labeling** — Auto-label images, videos, and text faster and more accurately. 

- **Vector Search** — Find a needle in the haystack across all of your unstructured data to create highly relevant content with pinpoint accuracy.

- **Resource Versioning** — Clarifai provides versioning for AI assets like datasets, models, and workflows, enabling users to track changes, compare model metrics against evolving datasets, and deploy specific model versions.

- **Data Ingestion** — Ingest individual inputs or archive files quickly with asynchronous processing to handle large volumes of data.

- **Dataset Management** — Manage datasets for model training, model  evaluation, and data labeling. 

- **Model Training & Evaluation** — Easily customize state-of-the-art AI models to fit custom needs. One-click training templates simplify training custom models and make custom AI accessible across teams.

- **AI Workflows** — Assemble models, agents, operators, and nodes with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to address diverse business use cases effortlessly.

- **AI Modules** — Make reusable web apps for any AI task. Extend Clarifai's SDKs with new views, features,  or processing capabilities.

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation** — Develop Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications by securely combining Foundation Models with your private data.
