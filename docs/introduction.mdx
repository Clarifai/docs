# Welcome

**Orchestrate and customize AI workloads on any infrastructure, at the scale you need**
<hr />

Clarifai is a hybrid cloud AI orchestration platform for building, deploying, and managing AI at scale. The platform supports AI models developed with Clarifai's own set of tools or third-party frameworks, integrating community, private, and self-hosted models.

With Clarifai, teams can deploy AI workloads on our Shared Compute, Clarifai-managed dedicated cloud compute, or within their own VPCs, on-premise, hybrid, or edge envirnoments from a unified control plane.

Clarifai is designed for three core journeys:

-	**Compute** – Orchestrate AI models with cost-efficient deployment, scaling, and optimization across environments.
- **Control & Governance** – Manage AI resources, monitor performance, and track costs through a unified control plane.
- **Create & Manage** – Customize AI workloads with a set of tools to compliment your own, enabling you to label data, train and evaluate models, and deploy them.

## Compute

- **Deploy AI Anywhere** — Run AI on any hardware, cloud, or on-premise infrastructure, including private VPCs or Clarifai’s managed compute.

- **Optimize Costs** — Leverage GPU fractioning, auto-scaling including scale-to-zero, and batched or streaming inference to more efficiently utilize compute resources.

- **Enterprise-Grade Security** — Manage access and permissions with role-based access controls, organizations and teams, and audit logging.

- **Scale to Production** — Deploy models with push-button builds and automated scaling.

## Unified Control and Governance

- **Monitor Performance** — Track model activity and system performance in real time.

- **Manage Cost** — Monitor resource usage and expenses across deployments.

- **Audit Activity** — Review time-stamped logs for updates and system changes.

- **Controll Acess** — Manage permissions and control who can create, update, or delete AI resources.

## Create and Manage

- **Automated Data Labeling** — Auto-label images, videos, and text faster and more accurately. 

- **Vector Search** — Search unstructured data with high precision.

- **Resource Versioning** — Track changes to datasets, models, and workflows by versioning your AI assets.

- **Dataset Management** — Ingest, exlore, and manage your datasets for model training, model  evaluation, and data labeling. 

- **Model Training & Evaluation** — Train AI models using one-click training templates and make custom AI accessible across teams.

- **AI Workflows** — Combine multiple models and operators with a drag-and-drop interface.

- **UI Modules** — Extend functionality with reusable web apps leveraging our APIs.
