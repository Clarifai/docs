# Search via the API

**Use vector search to find, sort, and filter what you need in your unstructured data**
<hr />


The API gives you full access to vector search capabilities, allowing you to programmatically search using AI-generated embeddings. You can retrieve inputs based on semantic similarity, filter results using metadata, and combine multiple conditions for more precise queries.

Whether you're working with images, text, or other data types, vector search via the API helps you surface the most relevant results quickly and at scale â€” making it ideal for building intelligent, customized search experiences into your own applications.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

import CodeOR from "!!raw-loader!../../../../code_snippets/python-sdk/Search/as/or.py";
import CodeORTS from "!!raw-loader!../../../../code_snippets/python-sdk/Search/as/or.ts";

import CodeAND from "!!raw-loader!../../../../code_snippets/python-sdk/Search/as/and.py";
import CodeANDTS from "!!raw-loader!../../../../code_snippets/python-sdk/Search/as/and.ts";

## OR Search Operation

The **OR** filter lets you expand your search to include results that match any of the specified conditions, rather than requiring all of them to be met.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python SDK">
    <CodeBlock className="language-python">{CodeOR}</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Node.js SDK">
    <CodeBlock className="language-typescript">{CodeORTS}</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## AND Search Operation

The **AND** operation enables you to refine search results by specifying multiple conditions that must all be satisfied at the same time. 

For example, if a user searches for images containing both the concepts "dog" and "deer," only those images labeled with both concepts will be returned.
