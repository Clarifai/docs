# Search via the API

**Search for people, places, objects, and topics in your unstructured data**
<hr />


AI models can be leveraged to power intelligent search across your data. When you upload inputs, our API automatically indexes them using your app's specified [base workflow](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/workflows/base-workflows), making them searchable right away. 

Once indexed, you can search for inputs by concept, visual similarity, metadata, and other custom criteria.
