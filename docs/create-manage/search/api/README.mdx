# Search via the API

**Use vector search to find, sort, and filter what you need in your unstructured data**
<hr />


The API gives you full access to vector search capabilities, allowing you to programmatically search using AI-generated embeddings. You can retrieve inputs based on semantic similarity, filter results using metadata, and combine multiple conditions for more precise queries.

Whether you're working with images, text, or other data types, vector search via the API helps you surface the most relevant results quickly and at scale â€” making it ideal for building intelligent, customized search experiences into your own applications.
