# Search via the UI

**Use vector search to find, sort, and filter what you need in your data**
<hr />

The Clarifaiâ€™s Smart Search feature on the Input-Manager screen allows you to harness the power of AI to search through unstructured or structured data with ease. 

Whether you're searching for images, videos, or text data, Smart Search empowers you to quickly find the content you need based on visual, semantic and/or conceptual understanding. 

With Smart Search, you can unlock the full potential of your data assets, making it easier than ever to locate and retrieve the data of interest. For example, you can use the search results within your app to accelerate [data labeling](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/annotate/create-get-update-delete) for custom model training tasks.

> The Input-Manager screen is the main page showcasing all the inputs in your app. You can access it by clicking the **Inputs** option in your app's collapsible left sidebar. The screen has [two modes](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/data/explorer/#input-manager): Input Mode (default) and Object Mode.
