# Search via the UI

**Use vector search to find, sort, and filter what you need in your unstructured data**
<hr />


Our Smart Search feature leverages vector search capabilities to power the search experience. 

Available directly on the Input-Manager screen, it enables you to seamlessly search through both structured and unstructured data by leveraging AI to surface the most relevant results with ease.

> **Note**: _The Inputs-Manager screen is the main page showcasing all the inputs in your app. You can access it by clicking the **Inputs** option in your app's collapsible left sidebar. The screen has [two modes](https://docs.clarifai.com/create-manage/inputs/#inputs-manager-screen): Input Mode (default) and Object Mode._

:::info

When performing a Smart Search with custom concepts, ensure that these concepts are first trained using an embedding-classifier model ([transfer-learning](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/model/model-types/transfer-learning/) model). Without this training, the search query may not work. On the Inputs-Manager screen, concepts that have already been trained with a model are marked with a blue circle, while untrained concepts are marked with a grey circle.

## Types of Smart Search

We offer the following types of Smart Search options in our platform.

- [**Smart Image Search**](https://docs.clarifai.com/create-manage/search/ui/visual/) — Allows you to retrieve images sorted by their visual relevance to a query in the form of: 
   - **Image** — Provide a reference image of interest to compare inputs against.
   - **Concept** — Provide a trained concept to compare input predictions against.
   - **Caption** — Provide a full-text description to compare inputs against.

- [**Smart Object Search**](https://docs.clarifai.com/create-manage/search/ui/object) — Allows you to retrieve annotated objects (bounding boxes within images) sorted by their visual relevance to a query in the form of:
  - **Image** — Provide a reference image of interest to compare inputs against.
  - **Concept** — Provide a trained concept to compare input predictions against.
  - **Caption** — Provide a full-text description to compare inputs against.

- [**Smart Text Search**](https://docs.clarifai.com/create-manage/search/ui/text-search) — Allows you to retrieve text data sorted by their content and semantic similarity to a query in the form of:
  - **Text** — Provide a text description to compare input predictions against. 
  - **Concept** — Provide a trained concept to compare input predictions against.
