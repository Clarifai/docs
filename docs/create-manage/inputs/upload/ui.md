# Upload via UI

**Add data to the Clarifai platform via the UI**
<hr />


To upload inputs, navigate to your individual app's page and select the **Inputs** option in the collapsible left sidebar. Then, click the **Upload Inputs** button located in the upper-right corner of the page. 

The inputs uploader window that pops up allows you to upload any type of input data â€” files from your local directory, texts, or publicly accessible URLs. 

Note that you can also use the inputs uploader modal to:

- Organize your inputs into [datasets](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/datasets/create-get-update-delete).

- [Add concepts to inputs](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/inputs-manager/concepts#via-the-inputs-uploader).

- Attach JSON metadata for additional context. Metadata are additional pieces of information you attach to your inputs when uploading them to the Clarifai platform. This can include product IDs, user IDs, or any other relevant details necessary for achieving specific outcomes

This modal simplifies the process of managing and enriching your inputs on the platform.

After uploading your inputs, click the **Upload Inputs** button located in the lower section of the uploader window. 

## Upload Texts

To upload a URL containing any supported data type, select the **URL** tab in the inputs uploader window and enter each URL on a separate line.  

> If you want to allow uploading identical URLs, toggle the **Allow duplicate URLs** button on.

## Uploads Status

The **Uploads** status window appears in the lower-right section of the page, enabling you to monitor the percentage progress of your upload. You can check the progress of any of your active uploads in the **Active** tab.

Once the upload process is complete, the **Inactive** tab will display a **Complete** status. 

:::note 

If you select the **Refresh when jobs finish** checkbox, the window will automatically refresh to display the status as soon as the upload process is finished. You'll also be notified if there is an issue with any of your inputs during uploading.
