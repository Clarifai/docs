# Create and Manage Concepts

**Put a word to it**
<hr />

A concept in machine learning is a label or tag used to describe an entity, similar to a keyword. It helps annotate data, allowing models to learn from patterns associated with that concept.

Over time, through training on annotated data, models can recognize or classify new data based on the concepts they've learned. Concepts are often called "classes" in machine learning tasks.

On the Clarifai platform, you can create and manage these concepts within your app to enhance your model's ability to recognize and categorize data.

Here are some best practices when creating concepts:

* Avoid special characters and spaces
* Avoid long concept names. Typically, 1-3 word concepts are best

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
