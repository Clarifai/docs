**Learn about our deep fine-tuning template types**
<hr />

You can take advantage of a variety of our pre-configured templates when developing your deep fine-tuned models. 

Templates give you the control to choose the specific architecture used by your neural network, and also define a set of hyperparameters that you can use to fine-tune the way your model learns.
