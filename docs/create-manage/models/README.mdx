# Create and Train Models

**Learn how to easily create and train new models**
<hr />


The Clarifai platform simplifies the entire process of creating and training AI models, making it incredibly easy and efficient. 

With just a single click, your model is not only trained but also automatically deployed, ready to enhance your business solutions instantly.

You can either build custom models tailored to your specific needs or jumpstart your projects with Clarifai's pre-optimized models, which are designed for immediate use.

## Custom Models

When you train a custom model, you are telling the system to look at all the inputs with concepts you've provided and learn from them. Then, when the model encounters new inputs, it could correctly generate predictions by applying the learned knowledge.

The train operation is asynchronous. It may take some time for your model to be fully trained and ready. Your model will be trained on all inputs that have been processed, and a new version will be created. 

## Clarifai Models


Clarifai models are designed to be fast, scalable, and highly flexible, providing the ability to quickly deploy solutions that can adapt to your specific business needs. They can simplify complex tasks, reduce development time, and deliver reliable, accurate results.

Our model library is continually expanding and evolving. You can explore the [Community](https://clarifai.com/explore) platform to find a model that best fits your needs.

:::tip 

You can use the [`Get`](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/model/create-get-update-and-delete#get) commands to view a complete list of available pre-built models that you can integrate into your application.

:::

Our models are fully "trainable" machine learning models developed in-house and rigorously tested, ready to make predictions right out of the box. 

We offer models across a wide range of categories, including generative models like large language models (LLMs), as well as classification, detection, and segmentation models.

:::info Try our Pre-Built Models

Before training your own model, we recommend trying these pre-built models to see if they meet your needs.
