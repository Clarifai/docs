# Get Started With Our Platform

**A quick-start guide on the Clarifai Community Platform**
<hr />

[Clarifai Community](https://clarifai.com/explore) is a low-code, no-code platform that provides everything you need to build AI-powered apps. You can use it to discover, test, create, and share a wide range of state-of-the-art AI resources, including:

- [Models](https://clarifai.com/explore/models) —  Allow you to convert inputs to outputs by generating predictions based on the patterns extracted from the input data; 

- [Workflows](https://clarifai.com/explore/workflows) — Allow you to create robust AI solutions by applying multiple models in a single flow;

- [Apps](https://clarifai.com/explore/apps) — Act as self-contained projects for storing, handling, and managing the data and resources related to the tasks you want to accomplish on the platform;

- [Modules](https://clarifai.com/explore/modules) — Allow you to create performant AI solutions by combining task-specific UI modules into your applications to do more.

Our platform offers powerful functionalities for computer vision, natural language processing, and audio recognition. With the full-lifecycle deep learning platform, you can transform unstructured images, videos, texts, and audio data into structured data at a significantly faster and more accurate rate than humans could do on their own.

:::danger end-to-end AI workspace

- We provide a seamless, end-to-end AI workspace that you can use to manage your data, annotate your inputs, and build custom models. 

- Instead of starting from scratch, you can find many pre-trained models and workflows in the platform. You can jumpstart your AI solutions with pre-built models from Clarifai, leading AI providers like Hugging Face, Meta, and Google, and other top contributors.

There are two ways to create an application:

![](/img/community/community_intro_pics/create_app_1.png)

- **Start with a blank app** — Begin from scratch, building your app from the ground up. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/applications/create-an-application).

- **Use a template** — Use pre-built blueprints to create apps quickly. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/app-templates).

Let's demonstrate how you can use the first option to create an app. 

After selecting the **Start with a Blank App** option, a window will appear requiring you to provide the required information to create a new application. 

Simply provide a unique app ID and go with the other default options.

Finally, click the **Create App** button at the upper-right corner of the page to complete the creation of your app. 

![create new app](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_new_app.png)

### Profile Icon

The **Profile Icon** navigation element lets you easily access the details related to your account on the Community platform. The icon is a small circle that contains either the initials of your name or a photo you've uploaded.

If you click the element, a drop-down list will appear with items that point to various pages within the Community platform. 

![profile icon](/img/community/community_intro_pics/profile_icon.png)

- **Organization profile** — This allows you to start using the Community platform with your [organization profile](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/clarifai-organizations/). If you select it, you’ll begin interacting with the platform as an organization — just like a normal user would, albeit with some other added capabilities. You can also add an organization from there, making it easier to collaborate and manage projects. 
- **My Apps** — This allows you to go to the apps’ listing page and access your own resources, such as apps, models, and workflows. 
- **Collaborations** — This allows you to access the apps that you share with other team members and work on together.

- **Security** — This allows you to access the security details associated with your account. If you select it, you’ll be redirected to a page that lets you update your password, create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)]( https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/authentication/personal-access-tokens), or activate [two-factor authentication](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/authentication/factor-authentication). 
- **Usage** — This allows you to access the [usage dashboard](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/usage-dashboard) that monitors how you consume Clarifai’s resources.  
- **Sign Out** — This allows you to log out of the Community platform. If you select it, you’ll be signed out of the platform. 

## How to Add Inputs

An input is any data you provide to the Community platform. You can upload your inputs — such as images, videos, audio, or texts — to be used for data labeling, training new models, performing searches, or making predictions.

To upload data, such as images, to an app you've created, navigate to the app’s individual page and select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar. We previously demonstrated [how to create an app](#create). 

Next, click the **Upload Inputs** button and upload the inputs you want to add to the app. A small window will pop up, allowing you to upload your inputs either directly from your local device or by providing a publicly accessible URL.

For this illustration, let's select the **URL** tab and provide the following images of dogs and cats:

```text
https://samples.clarifai.com/dog1.jpeg
https://samples.clarifai.com/dog2.jpeg
https://samples.clarifai.com/dog3.jpeg
https://samples.clarifai.com/cat1.jpeg
https://samples.clarifai.com/cat2.jpeg
https://samples.clarifai.com/cat3.jpeg
```

![upload inputs](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_upload_inputs.png)

Finally, click the **Upload inputs** button at the bottom of the pop-up window to complete uploading your inputs.

## How to Label Your Inputs

Labeling (also known as annotating) refers to the process of adding one or more relevant tags, or keywords — usually referred to as concepts — that best describe the state of your inputs. 

For example, annotations might indicate whether an image contains a dog or a cat, which words were spoken in a recorded audio file, or if a concrete block contains cracks.

:::caution data labeling

Successfully labeling data is a key ingredient to any custom AI solution. You can use a concept to annotate an input if that input has that entity. That’s how you prepare training data to teach your models to recognize new concepts. After training your model using the annotated concepts, the model can learn to recognize them when it encounters data without those tags.

:::

To label your inputs on the Clarifai platform, navigate to your app’s individual page and select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar. 

On the Input-Manager page, select the input(s) you like to label. For this illustration, let's start by selecting the images of dogs we added previously.

Next, click the **Label as …** button that appears on the bottom section of the page. 

![label inputs](/img/community/community_intro_pics/label_your_inputs.png)

The small window that pops up allows you to annotate the selected input(s) with concepts. Let's enter the `dog` concept in the **Concepts** field and click the **Add new concept** button. 

![add new concept](/img/community/community_intro_pics/add_new_concept.png)

Finally, click the **Add to inputs** button at the bottom of the pop-up window to complete labeling your images of dogs. 

Similarly, annotate your cat images with the `cat` concept.

After annotating the inputs, you'll find the annotations listed in the **Labels** section of the Input-Manager page.

![](/img/community/community_intro_pics/add_new_concept_1.png)

## How to Create and Train a Custom Model

The Clarifai Community platform makes it unbelievably easy to create and train new models. With a custom model, you can create a solution that best addresses your specific use case. 

To create a custom model, start by navigating to your app and uploading data, such as images of dogs and cats, and annotating them — as earlier described. The input data, labeled with concepts, is what will be used for training your model. 

After adding inputs and labeling them with the concepts you want your model to see, you can now proceed to create your own custom model.

Navigate to your app's individual page and select the **Models** option on the collapsible left sidebar. On the ensuing page, click the **Add Model** button at the upper-right corner of the page.

In the window that pops up, select the **Build a Custom Model** option and click the **Continue** button. 

![create new model](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_model.png)

Next, choose the type of model you want to create. For this example, we want to create a simple classification model that can identify the images of cats and dogs.

So, let’s choose the **Transfer Learn** model type, which uses the [transfer learning](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/model/model-types/transfer-learning) technique to leverage the knowledge gained from a pre-trained model to facilitate the learning process of a new model for a related problem. This lets us train new models in seconds, not minutes or hours.

![create transfer learning classifier](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_new_model.png)

On the ensuing page, provide a unique, memorable ID for your model.

Click the **Continue to Configure Model** button to create your model.

![](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_new_model_1.png)

Next, set up the details required to train your model.

![create custom model](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_model_page.png)

- **Dataset** — You can select a [dataset](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/datasets/create-get-update-delete) to use to train the model. Since we don't have a dataset for this example, we'll use the default dataset automatically generated with all the compatible labeled inputs in the app.

- **Base Embed Model** — You can select the base embed model to use for embeddings, which has to be one of the embed models in the app workflow. This allows you to specify the specific model in case the default workflow of your app has multiple embedding models present. For this example, let's go with the default option.

- **Concepts** — Select the concepts that you want the model to predict. For this example, let's choose the concepts of `dog` and `cat,` which we previously used to label our images.  

- **Concepts Mutually Exclusive** — Let's turn the button on to indicate no overlap between any of the model concepts.

- **Enrich Dataset** — If it's enabled (set to Automatic), it lets you enrich the model with supplemental data from pre-built datasets of negative embeddings, which improves the model's accuracy. Otherwise, setting it to Disabled lets you not use the negative embeddings, whether they are available or not. For this example, let's go with the default option.

- **Inference Settings**  —  Optionally, you can configure the inference settings for your model. For this example, let's go with the default option. 

- **Train Model** — After configuring the settings, click the **Train Model** button to begin training your model.

Once the model is trained, you can put it to work, such as use it to make predictions. We'll illustrate how to make predictions below.  

![](/img/community/community_intro_pics/trained_model_version.png)

As mentioned earlier, training helps your model learn from the annotated concepts in your inputs so that it can recognize them.

## How to Create a Workflow

Workflows is a useful Clarifai's feature that allows you to combine multiple models and carry out different operations on our platform. With workflows, you can create a powerful multi-model system that meets various use cases in a single call — instead of relying only on a single model.

You can create workflows out of any public models available on the Community platform or custom models that you have created for your app. The inputs and outputs supported by your custom models will depend on the inputs and outputs supported by the public models, or model templates that you have used to build them.

In this example, we'll create a simple custom workflow that first extracts text from an image and then translates the extracted text to Spanish.

We'll connect the following two models to achieve our objective:

- The [ocr-scene-english-paddleocr](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/ocr-scene-english-paddleocr) model, which detects and recognizes English texts in images;
- The [text-translation-english-spanish](https://clarifai.com/helsinkinlp/translation/models/text-translation-english-spanish) model, which translates texts from English to Spanish.

To start with, navigate to your app’s individual page and select the **Workflows** option on the collapsible left sidebar. Next, click the **Create Workflow** button at the upper-right corner of the page.

![select app workflows](/img/community/community_intro_pics/select_app_workflows.png)

You'll be redirected to a simple no-code, drag-and-drop interface that allows you to connect your models together. You'll need to connect the [`input nodes`](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/workflows/input-nodes) in your workflow. This allows you to link models to any models that precede them in the visual graph.

In the **Filter model type** search box on the left side of the page, search successively for an “optical-character-recognizer” node and a “text-to-text” node.

After finding each of the nodes, drag and drop each of them on the workspace pane. Also, draw a line that connects the two nodes, which shows the flow of information from one node to another.

![workflows workspace](/img/community/community_intro_pics/workflows_workspace.png)

Next, click the **optical-character-recognizer** button. In the search box that appears on the right side of the page, search for and select the **ocr-scene-english-paddleocr** model as the one you’ll use for optical character recognition. Its version will be automatically selected for you.

Similarly, click the **text-to-text** button and search for and select the **text-translation-english-spanish** model as the one you'll use for translating the extracted text from English to Spanish. 

Lastly, click the **Save Workflow** button to save the workflow. That will save the state of your workflow. Now you are ready to put it to work, such as use it to make predictions. We'll illustrate how to make predictions below.

![save workflow](/img/community/community_intro_pics/save_workflow.png)

Here is a video tutorial that showcases how to create two different multi-model workflows in the Community.

## How to Make Predictions

You can use your own custom models or workflows to make predictions on the Community platform. You can also get started right away by using one of the pre-optimized models or workflows published on the Community platform. 

When you upload an input to a model or workflow, you'll see its predictions. The platform analyzes the input and identifies its contents, returning a list of concepts along with the corresponding probabilities of each concept present in the input.

For example, you can use the pre-built Clarifai's [face-detection](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/face-detection) model to detect the location of human faces in images. If you go to its main page, you’ll notice that there are some default photos that show how the model works. There are bounding boxes around the detected faces. On the right side of the page, there are previews of the detected faces alongside the probability value of their correctness.

![face detection model](/img/community/community_intro_pics/face_detection_model.png)

To make your own predictions using the model, click the blue **+** (plus) button. A modal will pop up, providing a convenient interface for adding input data and examining predictions.

![](/img/community/community_intro_pics/face_detection_model_1.png)

Select the **Try your own image or video** option. A small window will appear, allowing you to upload the image you want to analyze and see its face predictions.

![](/img/community/community_intro_pics/face_detection_model_2.png)

For this example, let's use [this image]( https://samples.clarifai.com/featured-models/face-crowd-of-monks-orange-robe.jpg) of a crowd of seated monks. After uploading the image, the model will analyze it and return a list of faces identified on the right-hand side of the page.
