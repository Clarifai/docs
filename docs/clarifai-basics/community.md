# Get Started With Community Portal

**A quick-start guide on the Clarifai Community Portal**
<hr />

Clarifai Community is a low-code, no-code platform that provides everything you need to build AI-powered apps. You can use it to discover, test, create, and share  state-of-the-art AI models, workflows, and app components.

Community offers powerful tools and resources for computer vision, natural language processing, and audio recognition. With the full-lifecycle deep learning platform, you can transform unstructured images, videos, texts, and audio data into structured data at a significantly faster and more accurate rate than humans could do on their own.

It provides a seamless, end-to-end AI workspace that you can use to manage your data, annotate your inputs, and build custom models. 

You can also find lots of pre-trained models and workflows, including high-quality models built by Clarifai, Hugging Face, Meta, Google, and other top contributors.

## How to Add Inputs

An input is any data you provide to the Community platform. You can upload your inputs—such as images, videos, audios, or texts—to be used for data labeling, training new models, performing searches, or making predictions.

You need to start by creating an application. To do so, log in to your account and click the **Create an App** button at the top-right section of the navigation bar. 

And on the small window that pops up, provide the information required to create a new application.

![create new app](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_new_app.png)

To upload data, such as images, to the app you've created, navigate to the app’s individual page and select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar. 

Next, click the **Upload Inputs** button and upload the inputs you want to add to the app.

![upload inputs](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_upload_inputs.png)

The small window that pops up allows you to upload your inputs—either by uploading them directly from your local device or by providing a publicly accessible URL.

![upload image inputs](/img/community/community_intro_pics/upload_inputs.png)

Finally, click the **Upload inputs** button at the bottom of the pop-up window to complete uploading your inputs.

## How to Label Your Inputs

Labeling (also known as annotating) refers to the process of adding one or more relevant tags, or keywords—usually referred to as concepts—that best describe the state of your inputs. 

For example, annotations might indicate whether an image contains a jogger or a cyclist, which words were spoken in a recorded audio file, or if a concrete block contains cracks.

Successfully labeling data is a key ingredient to any custom AI solution. You can use a concept to annotate an input if that input has that entity. That’s how you prepare training data to teach your models to recognize new concepts. 

After training your model using the annotated concepts, the model can learn to recognize them when it encounters data without those tags.

To label your inputs on the Clarifai platform, navigate to your app’s individual page and select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar. On the inputs’ manager page, select the input(s) you like to label and click the **Label as …** button that appears on the bottom section of the page. 

![label inputs](/img/community/community_intro_pics/label_your_inputs.png)

The small window that pops up allows you to annotate the selected input(s) with concepts. Enter the concept(s) you want to add in the **Concepts** field and click **Add new concept**. 

![add new concept](/img/community/community_intro_pics/add_new_concept.png)

Finally, click the **Add to inputs** button at the bottom of the pop-up window to complete labeling your inputs.

## How to Create and Train a Custom Model

The Clarifai Community platform makes it unbelievably easy to create and train new models. With a custom model, you can create a solution that best addresses your specific use case. 

To create a custom model, start by navigating to your app and uploading data, such as images, to it. The input data, labeled with concepts, is what will be used for training your model. 

After adding inputs that already contain the concepts you want your model to see, you can now proceed to create your own custom model.
Select the **App Models** option on the collapsible left sidebar. And on the ensuing page, click the **Create Model** button on the top-right corner of the page.

![create new model](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_model.png)

Next, choose the type of model you want to create. For this example, let’s choose a **Transfer Learning Classifier**. 

![create transfer learning classifier](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_new_model.png)

On the ensuing page, provide the details required to create the custom model. For this example, let's provide the model id, select the concepts we created previously, and set the **Concepts mutually_exclusive** button to true. 

You can also fill the other fields if you want to. 

![create custom model](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_create_model_page.png)

After configuring the model, click the **Create Model** button at the bottom of the page.

You'll be redirected to the created model's page.

Finally, click the **Train Model** button on the upper right-hand corner of the page. 

![Create model page](/img/community/community_intro_pics/custom_model_created_model_page.png)

Once the model is trained, you can put it to work. 

As mentioned earlier, training helps your model to learn from the annotated concepts on your inputs so that it can be able to recognize them.

## How to Create a Workflow

Workflows is a useful Clarifai's feature that allows you to combine multiple models and carry out different operations on our platform. With workflows, you can create a powerful multi-model system that meets various use cases in a single call—instead of relying only on one model.

You can create workflows out of any public models available on the Community or custom models that you have created for your app. The inputs and outputs supported by your custom models will depend on the inputs and outputs supported by the public models, or model templates that you have used to build them.

In this example, we'll create a simple custom workflow that first extracts text from an image and then translates the extracted text to Spanish.

We'll connect the following two models to achieve our objective:

- The [ocr-scene-english-paddleocr](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/ocr-scene-english-paddleocr) model, which detects and recognizes English texts in images;
- The [text-translation-english-spanish](https://clarifai.com/helsinkinlp/translation/models/text-translation-english-spanish) model, which translates texts from English to Spanish.

To start with, navigate to your app’s individual page and select the **App Workflows** option on the collapsible left sidebar. Next, click the **Create Workflow** button on the top-right corner of the page.

![select app workflows](/img/community/community_intro_pics/select_app_workflows.png)

You'll be redirected to a simple no-code, drag-and-drop interface that allows you to connect your models together. You'll need to connect the [`input nodes`](https://docs.clarifai.com/community/workflows/input-nodes) in your workflow. You can link your models to any models that precede them in the visual graph.

In the **Filter model type** search box on the left-side of the page, search successively for an “optical-character-recognizer” model and a “text-to-text” model.

After finding each of the models, drag and drop each of them on the workspace pane. Also, draw a line that connects the two models, which shows the flow of information from one model to another.

![workflows workspace](/img/community/community_intro_pics/workflows_workspace.png)

Next, click the **optical-character-recognizer** button. And on the search box that appears on the right side of the page, specify the **ocr-scene-english-paddleocr** model as the one you’ll use for optical character recognition. Also, select the version of the model you want to use—since a model could have several versions.

Similarly, click the **text-to-text** button and specify the **text-translation-english-spanish** model as the one you'll use for translating the extracted text from English to Spanish. Also, select its version.

Lastly, click the **Save Workflow** button to save the workflow. That will save the state of your workflow. 
Now you are ready to predict using your brand-new workflow.

![save workflow](/img/community/community_intro_pics/save_workflow.png)

Here is a video tutorial that showcases how to create two different multi-model workflows in the Community.

## How to Make Predictions

You can use your own custom models or workflows to make predictions on the Community platform. You can also get started right away by using one of the pre-optimized models or workflows published on the Community. 

Predictions are ready the moment you upload an input. The platform analyzes your inputs and tells you what's inside of them. It will return a list of concepts with corresponding probabilities of how likely it is those concepts are contained within the provided input.

For example, you can use the pre-built Clarifai's [face-detection](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/face-detection) model to detect the location of human faces in images and videos.

If you go to the model’s main page, you’ll notice that there are some default photos that show how the model works. There are bounding boxes around the detected faces. On the right side of the page, there are previews of the detected faces alongside the probability value of their correctness.

![face detection model](/img/community/community_intro_pics/face_detection_model.png)

To make your own predictions, click the **Try your own image or video** button at the bottom-right section of the page. Next, upload an image you want to view its predictions.

For example, you can use [this image]( https://samples.clarifai.com/featured-models/face-crowd-of-monks-orange-robe.jpg) of a crowd of seated monks. 

After uploading the image, the model will analyze it and return a list of faces identified on the right-hand side of the page.
