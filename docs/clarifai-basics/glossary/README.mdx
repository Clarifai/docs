# Key Terminology to Know

**A Glossary of General AI Terms for Using the Clarifai Platform Effectively**
<hr />

## A

### A/B Testing

A statistical way of comparing two (or more) techniques, typically an incumbent against a new rival. It aims to determine which technique performs better, and whether the difference is statistically significant.

### Accuracy 

The fraction of correct predictions a model got right. The goal of any model is to get it to see the world as you see it.

- In Multi-class classification, accuracy is determined by the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of examples.
- In Binary classification, or for two mutually exclusive classes, accuracy is determined by the number of true positives added to the number of true negatives, divided by the total number of examples.

### Activation Function

In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs.

### Active Learning

A machine learning term that refers to various methods for actively improving the performance of trained models.

### Adversarial Example

Adversarial examples are specialized inputs created with the purpose of confusing a neural network, resulting in the misclassification of a given input. These
notorious inputs are indistinguishable to the human eye, but cause the network to fail to identify the contents of the image.

### Adversarial Machine Learning

A research field that lies at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and computer security. It enables the safe adoption of ML techniques in adversarial settings like spam filtering, malware detection, etc.

### Agents

In the context of AI, agents are software that can independently perform specific tasks without human intervention. They often employ various tools, like calculators or web browsing, to process data and develop solutions.

### Agent System Operators

[Agent system operators](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/agent-system-operators/) are "non-trainable," or "fixed function," models that help you connect, route, and control the inputs and outputs that you send through your workflows. Operator models are critical building blocks for creating more advanced workflows.

:::note Operators Examples

-	**Concept Thresholder** allows you to threshold input concepts according to both a threshold and an operator (>, >=, =, <=, or <). For example, if you use the " > " threshold type and set the threshold value to 0.9, only concepts that have been predicted with a confidence score greater than 0.9 will be sent as outputs from the concept thresholder, and other concepts will be ignored. 
-	**Region Thresholder** allows you to threshold regions based on the concepts that they contain using a threshold per concept and an overall operator (>, >=, =, <=, or <). 
-	**Random Sampler** allows you to randomly allow an input to pass to the output.
-	**Image Cropper** allows you to crop the input image according to each input region that is present in the input.
-	**Image Align** allows you to align images using key points.
-	**Annotation Writer** allows you to write the input data to the database in the form of an annotation with a specified status as if a specific user created the annotation.
-	**Regex-Based Classifier** allows you to classify text using regular expressions. When the specified regex pattern matches the text, the text is assigned to one of the predefined concepts.
-	**Concept Synonym Mapper** allows you to map the input concepts to output concepts by following synonym concept relations in the knowledge graph of your app.

:::

### Anchor Box 

The archetypal location, size, and shape for finding bounding boxes in an object detection problem. For example, square anchor boxes are typically used in face detection models. 

### Annotation 

The "answer key" for each image. Annotations are markups placed on an image (bounding boxes for object detection, polygons or a segmentation map for segmentation) to teach the model the ground truth. 

### Annotation Format

The particular way of encoding an annotation. There are many ways to describe a bounding box's size and position (JSON, XML, TXT, etc) and to delineate which annotation goes with which image. 

### Annotation Group 

Describes what types of objects you are identifying. For example, "chess pieces" or "vehicles."

### API Key

[An API key](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/authentication/app-specific-api-keys) is essentially a “password” for accessing the API. Accounts are billed for API calls, and this helps us keep track of activity.

### Application

An application is literally what it sounds like: an application of AI to an existing challenge. It’s a self-contained project for storing and handling, data, annotations, models, concepts, datasets, workflows (chaining of models together), and searches.


:::warning self-contained project

An operation performed in one application will return results from data within that application, but will be blind to data in other applications. You can create as many applications as you like and can divide your use among them to segment data into collections and manage access accordingly. Usually, you would create a new application for each new set of related tasks you want to accomplish.

:::

### Application Programming Interface (API)

A set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

:::note

Clarifai’s API allows users to access the Clarifai platform through four request types:

- POST - Upload inputs and information
- PATCH - Update or modify existing information
- GET - Request information
- DELETE - Delete existing information

:::

### Application Template

Clarifai [app templates](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/app-templates) are pre-built blueprints that provide a starting point for creating your own applications. They are apps with their contents grouped by some use case — enabling you to easily get started building your applications.

### Architecture 

A specific neural network layout (layers, neurons, blocks, etc). These often come in multiple sizes whose design is similar except for the number of parameters. 

### Artificial General Intelligence 

Computational system that can perform any intellectual task a human can. Also called "Strong Al." At this point, AGI is fictional.

### Artificial Intelligence 

The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using it), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.

### Artificial Neural Network

### Artificial Super Intelligence 

Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) refers to a level of AI that surpasses human intelligence across all domains, including creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence.

### AUC Score

The AUC, or area under the ROC curve, is a metric used to measure the performance of a binary classifier, such as a spam filter or fraud detector. It’s a numerical value between 0 and 1 that represents the overall performance of the classifier and its degree of separability, where 1 means the classifier is perfect at distinguishing between two classes, and 0.5 means it’s no better than a coin flip.

### Audio Speech Recognition (ASR) 

A technology that processes human speech into readable text. 

:::warning Audio Transcription Models

These models take audio containing speech and convert it into text. These can be extremely useful as they allow audio to be searched for key terms, or AI models to transmit text instead of audio over networks, which is much smaller and faster.

:::

### Authentication

[Authentication](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/authentication/) is the process of verifying someone's claimed identity. It's essentially confirming that a user trying to access a system or resource is who they say they are.

:::warning Two-Factor Authentication

[Two-factor authentication](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/authentication/factor-authentication) (2FA) is an optional sign-in security feature that provides an additional layer of security to your account.

:::

### Authorization

[Authorization](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/authentication/authorize), following authentication, determines what a user is allowed to do with a system or resource  after their identity has been verified.  It's about granting specific permissions based on a user's role or privileges.

### Auto-Annotation

[Auto-annotation](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/workflows/common-workflows/auto-annotation-walkthrough/), also known as automatic annotation or automated labeling, refers to the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to automatically generate annotations or labels for data. 

### Automation Bias 

When a human decision maker favors recommendations made by an automated decision-making system over information made without automation, even when the automated decision-making system makes errors. 

### AutoML 

Automates each step of the ML workflow so that it’s easier for users with minimal effort and machine learning expertise.

### Autonomous AI

The most advanced form of AI is autonomous artificial intelligence, in which processes are automated to generate the intelligence that allows machines, bots and systems to act on their own, independent of human intervention. It is often used in autonomous vehicles.

## B

### Backpropagation 

The main algorithm used for performing gradient descent on neural networks. Short for "backward propagation of errors," it’s an algorithm for supervised learning of artificial neural networks using gradient descent. Given an artificial neural network and an error function, the method calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural network weights.

### Backward Chaining 

A method where the model starts with the desired output and works in reverse to find data that might support it. 

### Base Workflow

One of Clarifai's pre-built workflows that can be built upon to create a custom model. It pre-indexes inputs for search and provides a default embedding space. 

:::warning default knowledge base

The [base workflow](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/workflows/base-workflows/) acts as the default knowledge base for your app and provides the basic structure for indexing your data. It gives you a "head start" when working with your data — by pre-indexing your inputs for search and by providing a default embedding for your custom models.

:::

### Baseline

A model used as a reference point for comparing how well another model (typically, a more complex one) is performing. Baseline models help developers quantify the minimal expected performance that a new model must achieve to be useful. 

### Batch

The set of examples used in one iteration (that is, one gradient update) of model training. 

### Batch Inference 

Asynchronous process that is executing predictions based on existing models and observations, and then stores the output.

### Batch Size

The number of training examples utilized in one iteration.

###  Bayes's Theorem

A famous theorem used by statisticians to describe the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to an occurrence.

###  Bias

When an Al algorithm produces results that are systemically prejudiced due to erroneous assumptions in the machine learning process.

:::caution Narrow training data

It occurs when the scope of your training data is *too narrow*. If you only see green apples, you’ll assume that all apples are green and think red apples are another kind of fruit. If the training data contains only a small number of examples, it’ll react accordingly, taking it as truth. Small datasets make for a smaller worldview.

:::

###  Big Data

Big data refers to data that is so large, fast or complex that it's difficult or impossible to
process using traditional methods.

###  Binary Classification/Mutually Exclusive

The task of classifying elements of a set into two groups on the basis of a classification
rule i.e. a model that evaluates email messages and outputs either spam or not spam is a binary classifier.

:::warning  Mutual Exclusivity

Mutual exclusivity means the outcomes are disjoint if they cannot both be true. When classes are referred to as “mutually exclusive,” this means that the neural network will only predict an input as a single concept, and no other classes or concepts. 

In this case, there is no intersection between any of the classes for a model. For instance, a network may classify an image as a cat or dog, but not both. If the goal of a model is to recognize only ONE concept for an input, making the concepts in your model mutually exclusive will give you stronger, more accurate predictions.

:::

###  Black Box Al

An Al system whose inputs and operations are not visible to the user. A black box, in a general sense, is an impenetrable system. 

### Boosting

A machine learning technique that iteratively combines a set of simple and not very accurate classifiers (referred to as "weak" classifiers) into a classifier with high accuracy (a "strong" classifier) by upweighting the examples that the model is currently misclassifying.

###  Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is any test or metric that uses random sampling with replacement and falls under the broader class of resampling methods. Bootstrapping assigns measures of accuracy (bias, variance, confidence intervals, prediction error, etc.) to sample estimates.

###  Bounding Box

In an image, the (x, y) coordinates of a rectangle around an area of interest.

### Brute Force Search

A search that isn't limited by clustering/approximations; it searches across all inputs. Often more time-consuming and expensive, but more thorough.

### Bucketing 

Converting a feature into multiple binary features called buckets or bins, typically based on value range. For example, concepts can be moved into “bins” of outcomes, based on prediction return values.

### BYTE Tracker 

[BYTE Tracker](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/agent-system-operators/tracker#byte-tracker) is a multi-object tracking by-detection model built upon the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) principles. Multi-object tracking aims to predict the bounding boxes and identities of objects within video sequences.

## C

### Calibration Layer

A post-prediction adjustment, typically to account for prediction bias. The adjusted predictions and probabilities should match the distribution of an observed set of labels.

### Centroid Tracker

[Centroid Tracker](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/agent-system-operators/tracker#centroid-tracker) is a tracking model that relies on the Euclidean distance between centroids of regions in different video frames to assign the same track ID to detections of the same object.

### Chatbot

Simulates human conversation, using response workflows or artificial intelligence to interact with people based on verbal and written cues. Chatbots have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years and in the future may be indistinguishable from humans.

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

A technique used in AI language models to produce more reasoned, step-by-step outputs, especially in problem-solving tasks.

### Checkpoint

Data that captures the state of the variables of a model at a particular time. Checkpoints enable exporting model weights, performing training across multiple sessions and continuing training past errors.

### Class

One of a set of enumerated target values for a label. For example, in a binary classification 
model that detects spam, the two classes are spam and not spam. In a multi-class classification model that identifies dog breeds, the classes would be poodle, beagle, pug, etc.

### Class Balance

The relative distribution between the number of examples of each class used to train a model. A model performs better if there are a relatively even number of examples for each class.

### Classification

The process of grouping and categorizing objects and ideas recognized, differentiated, and understood in data.

:::warning Classification Models

These models read an input such as text, image, audio, or video data and generate an output that classifies it into a category. For example, a language classification model might read a sentence and determine whether it's in French, Spanish, or Italian.

:::

### Classification Threshold

### Computer Vision

Field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

### Concept

A concept is something that describes an entity in the physical world, similar to a “tag” or “keyword.” Concepts are also known as "classes" in the field of machine learning.

You can use a concept to annotate an input if that input has that entity. You can also add it to a model if you want that model to be able to recognize that entity. The data in these concepts give the model something to “observe” about the keyword, and learn from.

### Confidence

A model is inherently statistical. Along with its prediction, it also outputs a confidence
value that quantifies how sure it is that its prediction is correct.

### Confidence Threshold

We often discard predictions that fall below a certain bar. This bar is the confidence threshold.

### Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. The confusion matrix itself is relatively simple to understand, but the related terminology can be… confusing.

:::info

It’s a table that summarizes how successful a classification model's predictions were; that is, the correlation between the label and the model's classification. Concepts that co-occur, or are similar, may appear as clusters on the matrix. On the other hand, exclusive or dissimilar concepts should not form a cluster. 

:::

### Container

A virtualized environment that packages its dependencies together into a portable environment. Docker is one common way to create containers.

### Convolution

Convolution means spiral, or, mathematically, two functions that produce a third function, which can be a modification of one of the originals. It’s a type of block that helps a model learn information about relationships between nearby pixels.

In deep learning, this is the step that extracts features from the input image. This step allows our algorithm to take these features and plot them in a vector — effectively allowing it to “see” these features.

## D

### Data

In the data science and AI world, data is any collection of information that is converted into a digital form. Data is plural, with the singular being “datum.”

:::tip

It’s important to distinguish between structured and unstructured data:

- Structured data is highly specific and is stored in a predefined format, such as a spreadsheet table;

### Edge Computing

A distributed computing framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data sources such as loT devices or local edge servers.

### Embeddings

A low-dimensional representation of a model’s input that has rich semantic information. It involves conversions of data to a feature representation where certain properties can be represented by notions of distance in a neural network. In other words, the translation of data to a continuous, fixed-length representation of something that is otherwise difficult to represent.

:::warning Embedding models

### False Positives

An error where a model falsely predicts the presence of the desired outcome in an input, when in reality it is not present (Actual No, Predicted Yes).

### Feature Extraction

The process of transforming raw data into a more usable format for machine learning algorithms. It involves identifying and extracting the most relevant pieces of information (features such as texture, shape, lines, and edges) from the data, while discarding irrelevant details. 

### Fine-Tuning

[Fine-tuning](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/model/deep-training/) is a deep learning technique that refers to taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a new dataset or task. The term "fine-tuning" implies making small adjustments or refinements to the already learned representations in the pre-trained model rather than training from scratch. It leverages the power of pre-trained models to improve their performance on a new, related task. It involves taking a pre-trained model, which was previously trained on a vast dataset for a general-purpose task, and tailoring it to a more specific task.

### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) 

A specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, and more. 

### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Memory

The amount of information your GPU can fit on it. A bigger GPU will be able to process more information in parallel which means it can support bigger models (or bigger batch sizes) without running out of memory. If you run out of GPU memory, it will crash your program.

### Green AI 

Efforts to make AI more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly are gaining momentum, with a focus on reducing the carbon footprint of training and running AI models. 

### Grid Search 

Grid search is a tuning technique that attempts to compute the optimal values of hyperparameters for training models by performing an exhaustive search through a subset of hyperparameters.

### Ground Truth 

The answer key for your dataset. This is how you judge how well your model is doing and calculate the loss function we use for gradient descent. It's also what we use to calculate our metrics.

:::warning important

Having a good ground truth is extremely important. Your model will learn to predict based on the ground truth you give it to replicate.

:::
