# Your First Visual Search App (~1 min)

**Perform your first visual search in approximately 1 minute**
<hr />

Visual search is a versatile and useful tool when you are working with visual data. Visual search helps you compare images based on their visual similarity.

In this example, we want to perform a visual similarity search on people's faces. 

## Step 1: Set up your account or log in

Just [click here](https://clarifai.com/signup) if you need to set up your account for the first time. 

Or [click here](https://clarifai.com/login) to log in.‌

## Step 2: Verify your email address

If you created a new account, check your email. We will send you a link that enables you to automatically verify your address.‌

## Step 3: Create an application

Log in to your account and click the **Create an App** button at the upper-right section of the navigation bar.

And on the small window that pops up, provide the information required to create a new application. Also, select "Face" as the base model.

Your newly created application will appear on the apps listing page.

If you click on the application, you'll be redirected to its individual page, where you can upload inputs to it. 

## Step 4: Upload sample images

On the application's individual page, select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar.

Next, click the **Upload inputs** button.

The small window that pops up allows you to upload inputs—either by uploading them directly from your local device or by providing a publicly accessible URL. 

Add several images of people's faces.

Finally, click the **Upload inputs** button at the bottom of the pop-up window to complete uploading your images.

## Step 5: Search for similar faces

Your uploaded images will appear on the inputs manager page. 

You can begin the search by clicking the spyglass icon next to the image you want to see its similar faces.

Clarifai will sort your images by visual similarity. In this example, we can see that the top-ranking results are images of older people.

That's it!
