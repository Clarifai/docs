When we talk about artificial intelligence, we are generally talking about computer systems that can make predictions. What is being predicted, you ask? Predictions usually include at least two parts:

* Model output(s)
* Some kind of accuracy score (sometimes this part is hidden under the hood)

Why is this considered "intelligence"? Your model is offering you ideas, and telling you which ideas it is most confident about.

This turns out to be a very useful way to do computing. And due to the diligent work of our engineers and research scientists, Clarifai models can deliver predictions in the form of many different types of model outputs.

Let's start with the the most common type of prediction: "concepts".

## Step 1: Set up your account or login
Just [click here](https://portal.clarifai.com/signup) if you need to set up your account for the first time. Or [click here](https://portal.clarifai.com/login) to login.‌

## Step 2: Verify your email address
Check your email. We will send you a link that enables you to automatically verify your email.‌

## Step 4: Upload an image
In the Clarifai Portal, you can upload images, videos, and text in "Data Mode". Click "Add Inputs", or visit Data Mode by clicking the icon on the lefthand side of the screen.‌

In this example, we are using the "General" model, which comes pre-loaded in "my-first-application". The General model is designed to work with images and videos. 

Click "Browse Files" and upload one or more of your own images.‌

You will be prompted to Add or Assign Concepts. Let's skip this step for now.

## Step 5: Take a look at your first predictions
Click the "eye" icon on the lefthand sidebar to explore your data.

Click on your image and take a look at your first predictions! The General model you selected can recognize over 11,000 concepts right out of the box.

That's it!
