# Your First AI Predictions (~1 min)

**Get your first AI prediction in approximately 1 minute**
<hr />

When we talk about artificial intelligence, we are generally talking about computer systems that can make predictions. What is being predicted, you ask?

Predictions usually include at least two parts:

* Model output(s)
* Some kind of accuracy score (sometimes this part is hidden under the hood)

Why is this considered "intelligence"?

Your model is offering you ideas, and telling you which ideas it is most confident about. This turns out to be a very useful way to do computing.

And due to the diligent work of our engineers and research scientists, Clarifai models can deliver predictions in the form of many different types of model outputs.

Let's start with the most common type of prediction: "concepts."

## Step 1: Set up your account or log in

Just [click here](https://clarifai.com/signup) if you need to set up your account for the first time. 

Or [click here](https://clarifai.com/login) to log in.‌

## Step 2: Verify your email address

If you created a new account, check your email. We will send you a link that enables you to automatically verify your address.‌

![verify email](/img/verify_email.png)

If you click the link in your email, you'll be redirected to the Portal and be prompted to complete setting up your profile.

## Step 3: Click "my-first-application"

Go to your apps listing page, where you'll find a default "my-first-application" already created. 

Click that application.

## Step 4: Upload an image

You'll be redirected to the application's individual page. Select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar. 

Next, click the **Upload inputs** button.

The small window that pops up allows you to upload your inputs—either by uploading them directly from your local device or by providing a publicly accessible URL. On the Clarifai Portal, you can upload images, videos, or text inputs.

Finally, click the **Upload inputs** button at the bottom of the pop-up window to complete uploading your image.

## Step 5: Take a look at your first prediction

:::note

In this example, we'll predict using the "General" workflow, which comes pre-loaded in every Clarifai application. It's a general image workflow that you can use to identify various concepts, such as objects, themes, and moods.

Once the image is uploaded, it appears on the inputs manager page. Click on that listed image.

![view explorer](/img/view-explorer.png)

You'll be redirected to the viewer page for that image, where you can take a look at your first prediction.

Once you're on the input viewer page, set the page's mode to **Predict**. You can find the mode settings at the top-right corner of the page. 

On the right sidebar, click the **Select a Model or Workflow** link.

![input viewer page](/img/select_model_or_workflow.png)

On the right sidebar that appears, click the **Select Model or Workflow** search box, and select the "General" workflow from the drop-down list. You can also choose another external model or workflow from the Community.

After selecting the workflow, the predictions will be processed and populated on the right sidebar.

That's it!
