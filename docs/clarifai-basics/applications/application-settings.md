## Base Workflow

A Base Workflow is the workflow you choose as the default knowledge base when creating an application. It optimizes your custom model performance.

You can change your app's base workflow by selecting another one from the list that drops down when you click the workflows search box. You can choose public workflows or workflows you've created in your app. 

After selecting your preferred Base Workflow, click the **Change Base Workflow** button.

## Transfer Application

You can transfer your application to an organization you belong to and have permission to create apps. This would greatly enhance collaboration and boost your productivity.

To do so, click the **Transfer** button. On the small window that pops up, select the app’s destination organization and give it a new name, if you want to.

Click the **Confirm** button to finalize the transfer.
