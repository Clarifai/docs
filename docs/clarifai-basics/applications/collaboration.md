# Collaboration

**How to collaborate on the Clarifai platform**
<hr />

Collaboration is a functionality that provides you with the ability to share your apps so that you can work with your team members to label data, create models, and more. This feature comes with the full control of the permissions available in your apps, which allows you to manage the capabilities and information available to each user. 

You can give a trusted collaborator full access. You can also invite a worker and grant them the limited permissions to only annotate data but not to delete it.

Just navigate to the app details page and click "Add Collaborators"

From here, enter the email addresses of the collaborators you would like to add. You can also choose the scope of the resources that you would like the collaborators to have access to.

:::important note

* Since API keys are tied to a specific user and a specific app, your collaborators cannot create their own API keys. 

* Collaborators also cannot invite other collaborators.
