# Applications

**Create applications to work with AI models on Clarifai**
<hr />

Applications are the basic building blocks for creating projects on the Clarifai platform. Your data, annotations, models, predictions, and searches are contained within applications. 
You can create as many applications as you want and edit or delete them as you see fit.

Applications include a variety of resources and provide control over access to those resources. Access to each application can be controlled using Personal Access Tokens (PATs) or more App-Specific API Keys.

You can learn more about [authentication](../authentication/) in the next section.
