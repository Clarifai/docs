# Labeling

**Assign relevant tags or keywords to inputs**
<hr />

Labeling, also known as annotation, is the process of assigning one or more relevant tags or keywords — commonly referred to as [concepts](https://docs.clarifai.com/create-manage/concepts/) — to describe the attributes or content of your inputs accurately.

For example, annotations might indicate whether an image contains a jogger or a cyclist, which words were spoken in a recorded audio file, or if a concrete block contains cracks.

Successfully labeling data is a key ingredient to any custom AI solution. You can use a concept to annotate an input if that input has that entity. That’s how you prepare training data to teach your models to recognize new concepts.

After training your model using the annotated concepts, the model can learn to recognize them when it encounters data without those tags.

Clarifai offers custom tools for labeling image, text, video, and audio inputs, as well as delegate and manage labeling projects of any size.
