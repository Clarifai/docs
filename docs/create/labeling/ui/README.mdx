## Single Input-Viewer

The single Input-Viewer is the main page that showcases the details of a single input available in your app. If you click an input listed on the Inputs-Manager page, you'll be redirected to the viewer page for that input, where you can view and interact with it.

### Key Features and Tasks 

You can complete several tasks on the Input-Viewer screen, including:

- Use the assistive tools at the top of the page to manually label your inputs. Learn more about them [below](#manual-labeling-tools). 
- Generate annotations for your inputs automatically using AI-assisted labeling. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/annotate/ai-assist).
- Use the **Search concepts** field in the right sidebar to find specific concepts and display their annotations on the page.
- Use the film strip at the left sidebar to swiftly move from one input to another. You can scroll through to get the specific image you want to annotate. If you click any image on the sidebar, it'll appear on the main workspace.
- Set the page's mode to **Predict**, and get predictions from your models and workflows. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/input-viewer/predictions). 
- Click the **View Metadata** button in the lower-left section to see details of the input, such as input ID, creation date, and resolution.

You can download the original asset directly from the page. If you right-click on the canvas area, a button will appear, which allows you to download the original input.

The Input-Viewer page offers a variety of keyboard shortcuts, or hotkeys, to streamline and speed up the labeling process. To view the available shortcuts for canvas-related activities, click the keyboard icon in the upper-right corner of the page. 

Additionally, there are other hotkeys you can use in the labeling process, which will be demonstrated later.

#### Display Controls

The **Display Controls** tool allows you to use an Electronic Light Table to adjust the visual settings of your input. It supports adjusting for brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also invert the colors by selecting the **Invert colors** checkbox.

If you select the **Save settings for future inputs** checkbox, your adjusted settings will be applied persistently across all inputs on the Input-Viewer page.

You can click the **Reset** button at the upper-right corner to restore the settings to their default values.
