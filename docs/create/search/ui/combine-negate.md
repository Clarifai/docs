# Combine or Negate

**Add or subtract items from your search query**
<hr />

Let's demonstrate how you can perform combined and negative searches on the Input-Manager screen. 

Go to your app and select the **Inputs** option on the collapsible left sidebar. You’ll be redirected to the Input-Manager page, where you can see the inputs available in your app. 

## Negate Search Criteria

You can find all the data that is NOT similar to a given criteria. 

On the **Labels** section on the Input-Manager screen, identify the concept you want to find its negative values and click the checkbox next to it. For example, let's search for all inputs that are NOT annotated as “dog”. 

After selecting the concept, hover over it. Double arrows will appear with the following tooltip: `Filter for inputs that do NOT match this value`. 

Click the double arrows to perform the negative search.

You’ll notice that the word **NOT** will be added to the concept, and the search results will be populated on the page.

## Combine Search Criteria

You can add multiple search parameters that expand your search criteria. You can even combine negated search terms for more advanced tasks. 

Combining search criteria always uses the "AND" operation. "OR" is not an option.

For example, you can combine two concepts and search by them.
