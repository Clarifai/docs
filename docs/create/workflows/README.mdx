# Workflows

**Combine multiple models and perform complex operations with workflows**

<hr />

Workflows is a useful, innovative Clarifai feature that allows you to combine multiple models and carry out different operations on our platform. With workflows, you can create a powerful multi-model system that meets various use cases in a single call â€” instead of relying only on one model.

Workflows provide a modular architecture for your inference pipeline. They provide the building blocks for advanced machine learning ensemble modeling and business logic.

Use workflows to process complex logic, gain insights, and build targeted solutions. With workflows, you can work with your machine learning models like they are nodes in a graph. 

Clarifai makes it easy to connect together models of different kinds so that you can perform complex operations on your data, and build solutions that target your specific business needs.
