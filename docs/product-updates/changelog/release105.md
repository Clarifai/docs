|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| ![new-feature](/img/new_feature.jpg)  | Added TypeScript (Node.js) SDK code snippets to the **Use Model / Workflow** modal window | If you want to use a model or a workflow for making API calls, you need to click the **Use Model / Workflow** button at the upper right corner of the individual page of a model or workflow. The modal that pops up has snippets in various programming languages, which you can copy and use. <br/> <br/>  <ul><li>We introduced TypeScript SDK code snippets as one of the tabs. Users can now conveniently access and copy the code snippets directly from the modal. </li></ul>|

|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)| Fixed an issue with sorting resources on mobile view  | <ul><li>We fixed an issue where the **Sort by** feature was not visible. You can now easily sort resources using these criteria on your mobile device.</li></ul>|
|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)|Fixed delayed loading of page contents| <ul><li>Previously, the notes section on Community pages did not appear immediately on the first render. We fixed the issue, ensuring the contents now load promptly as expected. </li></ul> |
|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)| Fixed a UI issue with modals | <ul><li>We fixed a UI issue where modal buttons would overflow the borders if the window height was too small. With this fix, modals are now fully responsive, ensuring that buttons remain within the borders regardless of the window height. </li></ul> |
| ![bug](/img/bug.jpg)   | Fixed an issue with user onboarding    |  <ul><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the **Create Application** modal from opening during the user onboarding process. </li></ul> |
| ![bug](/img/bug.jpg) | Fixed an issue with the placeholder search text on the Community page| <ul><li>We fixed an issue where the placeholder text in the main page's search bar was partially hidden on smaller screen sizes or when the browser was resized.

## Apps / Templates

|Status                                |Change                  |Details                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
|![improvement](/img/improvement.jpg)|Improved the handling of unauthenticated users|If a user is not logged in or lacks access to the app:<br/><br/><ul><li>We hide the Inputs block and its values. So, the user cannot see the inputs details on the App Overview page. </li><li>We direct the user to available public resources (e.g. models) without prompting for a login.</li></ul>|
| ![improvement](/img/improvement.jpg) | Added a "Reindex" checkbox in the "Change Base Workflow" section  |  <ul><li>This option allows users to decide whether they want to reindex their app's inputs before [changing the app's base workflow](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/workflows/base-workflows#how-to-change-a-base-workflow). </li></ul> |

|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)|Fixed the position of the collapse button in the app sidebar|<ul><li>Previously, the button for collapsing the app sidebar was misaligned. We fixed the issue, and the button is now properly positioned. </li></ul> |
|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)|Fixed an issue with filtering app templates| To view available templates, visit the **Apps / Templates** screen and select the ["Templates"](https://clarifai.com/explore/apps/templates) option.<br/><br/><ul><li>Previously, when sorting templates by "Last Updated," the list mistakenly included both apps and templates. To view only templates, users had to manually select "All" and then "Templates" again.</li><li>We fixed the issue. Now, when you sort by "Last Updated" on the Templates page, only templates are displayed as intended. </li></ul> |
| ![bug](/img/bug.jpg)  | Fixed an issue with truncated template names|<ul><li>Previously, in the template selection screen for creating an app, long template names were truncated and unreadable. We fixed the issue. For example, now, if template names don't fit in the available space, they are omitted, and a tooltip saying "Clarifai's Templates" appears on hover.</li></ul> |
| ![bug](/img/bug.jpg) | Added the ability to quickly delete the auto-completed App ID field  | <ul><li>We introduced a cross (X) icon to the App ID and Short Description fields, allowing users to quickly erase contents when setting up an app using a template.</li></ul>|

## Platform Resource Management

|Status                                |Change                  |Details                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| ![improvement](/img/improvement.jpg)| Improved ability to select a version of a resource   | <ul><li> We introduced a standardized version selection feature across the platform, now available on both the Model-Viewer and Dataset-Viewer pages. This feature allows you to select and view specific versions of your resources using truncated digits and dates for easy identification. </li></ul> |

## Input-Manager

|Status                                |Change                  |Details                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
|![improvement](/img/improvement.jpg) | Fixed an issue with the left sidebar  | <ul><li>We fixed an issue where the left sidebar on the Input-Manager and Input-Viewer was not scrollable. Previously, this made it difficult to access all sidebar content. With this improvement, the left sidebar is now scrollable, allowing you to easily bring all parts into view.</li></ul> |
| ![bug](/img/bug.jpg) | Fixed an issue with the scrolling behavior in the Input-Manager  | <ul><li>Previously, when the first batch of Input-Manager search results was fully visible on the screen without requiring scrolling, the page entered a broken state. This state made it difficult to scroll down to view more inputs and resulted in failure to fetch the next batch of inputs. We fixed the issue, and the scrolling behavior now works as desired. </li></ul>|

## Workflows

|Status                                |Change                  |Details                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Deprecation | Deprecated some tracker agent system operators | <ul><li>We deprecated the Neural Tracker and Neural Lite Tracker operators. These operators were previously used to chain together with other models in a workflow for object-tracking tasks in computer vision. We no longer support them. </li></ul>|
| ![bug](/img/bug.jpg) | Fixed an issue with a redundant close button  | <ul><li>  We fixed an issue where a redundant close button appeared in the modal for updating text-to-text workflow nodes. Previously, this caused two close buttons to be displayed instead of one. With this fix, we removed the redundant close button, ensuring only one close button is displayed in the modal.  </li></ul> |


## Python SDK

|Status                                |Change                  |Details                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
|  ![bug](/img/bug.jpg)    |  Fixed an issue where `get_upload_status` would override `log_warnings` in the `dataset.upload_dataset` function | <ul><li>The issue occurred because `self.logger` was shared between both loggers, causing the upload status table to overwrite the log file when both `get_upload_status` and `log_warnings` arguments were used simultaneously. We fixed the issue.</li></ul>  |
