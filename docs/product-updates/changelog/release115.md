##  Agentic Frameworks

|Status                                |Change                  |Details                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| ![new-feature](/img/new_feature.jpg)| Introduced support for [agentic frameworks](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/agents/)  | <ul> <li> This signifies a major advancement, enabling the development and orchestration of multi-step, goal-directed AI agents that can autonomously reason, plan, and take actions across Clarifai's platform.</li> <li> Additionally, Clarifai now integrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and enables building [MCP servers](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/agents/mcp). This allows Clarifai users to bridge their AI agents with enterprise data and external APIs, providing dynamic, real-time context. </li> </ul>  |

##  OpenAI Inferences

|Status                                |Change                  |Details                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
|  ![new-feature](/img/new_feature.jpg)| Introduced an [OpenAI-compatible](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/models/inference/open-ai) API endpoint  | <ul> <li>  This endpoint allows you to leverage your existing OpenAI API code and workloads to make inferences with Clarifai models.</li> </ul>  |



##  Token-Based Billing

|Status                                |Change                  |Details                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| ![new-feature](/img/new_feature.jpg)| Added initial support for token-based [billing](https://www.clarifai.com/pricing) for some large language models (LLMs) and image generation models  | <ul> <li> The token-based billing will align pricing with industry standards and better reflect the costs associated with these models. </li>  <li> The token-based pricing will be gradually applied only to inference on the Community using models deployed with Clarifai's default Shared compute. [Dedicated compute instances](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/deployments/deploy-model/) will continue to use per-compute-time billing, regardless of the type of model deployed. </li> <li> Also, the per-request billing will continue for legacy vision models on the Community. </li> </ul>  |
