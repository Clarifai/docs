# Clarifai Release Types

**Learn about the different types of our releases**
<hr />

Clarifai release types refer to the different stages or types of releases that our software product can go through â€” from development to deployment. These options help us manage the introduction of new features, bug fixes, and updates while ensuring quality and stability. 

We can issue a release at any of the following phases, based on the degree of maturity:

:::caution Attention

- Non-GA features are provided primarily for evaluation and feedback purposes and should NEVER be used for production workloads. 

- We could issue a release as an Enterprise-only feature, meaning it will be accessible exclusively to users on the Enterprise [pricing plan](https://www.clarifai.com/pricing).
