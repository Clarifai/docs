|![new-feature](/img/new_feature.jpg)|Published the BlazeFace face detection model for mobile GPUs|<ul><li>You can now use the [BlazeFace face detection model](https://clarifai.com/paddlepaddle/face/models/general-image-detector-blazeface_ssh-widerface) to detect faces in images. It is a lightweight and well-performing face detector tailored for mobile GPU inference.</li></ul>|
|![new-feature](/img/new_feature.jpg)|Published four different models for general image detection|<ul><li>The models are [Detic](https://clarifai.com/explore/models?searchQuery=detic): A <b>Det</b>ector with <b>i</b>mage <b>c</b>lasses that can use image-level labels to easily train detectors. They can detect twenty-thousand classes using image-level supervision.</li></ul>|
|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)|Fixed an issue where markdown notes exceeded page width|<ul><li>Previously, when a code block with large text existed in markdown notes, it exceeded the page width. This led to the model viewerâ€™s canvas expanding beyond the normal width and breaking without loading inputs well.</li></ul>|
|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)|Fixed an issue where a user's long app name broke the sidebar |<ul><li>A user's app had a long name that extended beyond the sidebar. The name was shortened.</li></ul>|
|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)|Fixed an issue where the synonym mapper model failed when used in a workflow|<ul><li>The synonym mapper model now works as expected when used in a workflow prediction.</li></ul>|
|![bug](/img/bug.jpg)|Fixed an issue where changing an existing model's template failed to work|<ul><li>Previously, editing the existing template of a visual-detector model did not work. The existing template and its corresponding parameters stayed the same even after selecting another template.</li></ul>|
