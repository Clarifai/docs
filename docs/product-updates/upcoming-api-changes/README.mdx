# Upcoming Platform Changes

**Learn about scheduled changes to the Clarifai platform**
<hr />

This page lists the changes that we want you to be aware of well in advance, as they may affect how you use the Clarifai platform. These changes include scheduled downtime and other improvements in the stability, performance, or functionality of the Clarifai platform, all aimed at better serving you as a customer.

Some of these changes may not be backward compatible and may require you to update how you call our APIs. We have created this page with the intention of being as transparent as possible, so that you can plan any corresponding changes in advance and minimize any interruptions to your usage of Clarifai services.

:::tip

The dates listed in the following tables indicate when we plan to implement the changes. While we may actually make the change in the days following the specified date, it is advisable to update your client-side code before that date to minimize any downtime to your applications.

:::

We will continue to regularly update this page, and a good way to stay up to date is by watching our [documentation repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Clarifai/docs).
