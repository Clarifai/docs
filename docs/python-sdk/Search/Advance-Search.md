# Advance Search Operations

In this section we are showcasing Clarifaiâ€™s  powerful capabilities for refining search results based on complex criteria. The use of AND and OR operations allows users to perform more nuanced searches, combining multiple conditions to precisely filter content. With AND, users can narrow down results to items that meet all specified criteria simultaneously, while OR expands the search scope to include items that meet any of the provided conditions. Additionally, leveraging custom concepts enables users to define their own labels or categories, further enhancing search flexibility.


## Custom Concepts

Searching with custom concepts in Clarifai involves associating user-defined labels or concepts with data, enabling more targeted searches. By specifying custom concepts like "dog," users can retrieve relevant results efficiently. This approach streamlines tasks such as content organization and classification, enhancing applications like image recognition and content moderation.

## OR

In Clarifai, the OR search operation provides users with a flexible means to retrieve search results that satisfy one or more specified criteria. By employing the OR filter, users can broaden their search scope to include items that meet any of the provided conditions.

## AND

In Clarifai, the AND operation allows users to refine search results by specifying multiple criteria that must all be met simultaneously. When conducting an AND search, the system retrieves items that fulfill all specified conditions, resulting in a subset of results that satisfy the intersection of the provided criteria. For example, if a user searches for images containing both "dog" and "deer" concepts, only images that are labeled as both dogs and deers will be returned.
