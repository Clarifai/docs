# Search

The search feature in Clarifai empowers users to query their dataset with precision, leveraging both ranking and filtering functionalities. With the ability to specify rank parameters, users can prioritize search results based on relevance or specific criteria, ensuring that the most pertinent items are surfaced first. This feature uses Cosine and Euclidean distance for performing search operation. Concurrently, filters allow for the refinement of search results, enabling users to narrow down their query based on attributes such as input types, status codes, or other custom metadata. By combining these capabilities, Clarifai's search feature offers a robust solution for efficiently locating and managing content within a dataset, facilitating tasks like image organization, content moderation, and visual similarity detection with ease and accuracy.
