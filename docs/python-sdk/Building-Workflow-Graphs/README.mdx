# Building Workflow Graphs

**Learn how to build workflows using Clarifai Python SDK**
<hr />

Unlock the potential of efficient data processing pipelines tailored precisely to your unique requirements with this empowering feature. As you embark on the journey of constructing workflow graphs, you gain unprecedented flexibility to seamlessly connect and orchestrate a diverse array of models, operators, and processing steps. Whether your focus is on integrating sophisticated image classification, precise object detection, or custom operators, our SDK offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Experience the freedom to effortlessly create, modify, and optimize workflow graphs, empowering you to design and implement highly specialized data processing pipelines that align seamlessly with your specific needs.

## Create workflow

Designing and implementing workflows is a crucial aspect of building a robust and flexible inference pipeline. Workflows  offer a modular architecture that serves as the foundation for both sophisticated machine learning ensemble modeling and seamless integration of business logic. These workflows empower you to streamline your processes, enhance model performance, and effectively handle diverse tasks in your machine learning endeavors. Workflow can be created with the SDK using a YAML specification.

## Examples for YAML based Workflows :

### ASR Sentiment

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) sentiment analysis refers to the process of analyzing the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in spoken language using ASR model.

### Demographics

This is a Multi-model workflow that detects, crops, and recognizes demographic characteristics of faces. Visually classifies age, gender, and multi-culture.

<CodeBlock className="language-text">{CodeOutputDemoYaml}</CodeBlock>



### Face Search

A workflow that combines detection, recognition, and embedding to generate face landmarks and enable visual search using detected faces's embeddings.

<CodeBlock className="language-text">{CodeOutputFaceSYaml}</CodeBlock>



### Face Sentiment

Multi-model workflow that combines face detection and sentiment classification of 7 concepts: anger, disgust, fear, neutral, happiness, sadness, contempt.
<CodeBlock className="language-text">{CodeOutputFaceSentiYaml}</CodeBlock>


### General

A general image detection workflow that detects a variety of common objects, and enable visual search using general embeddings on detected regions.
<CodeBlock className="language-text">{CodeOutputGenYaml}</CodeBlock>


### Language Aware OCR

A workflows that performs OCR in different languages.

<CodeBlock className="language-text">{CodeOutputLangAYaml}</CodeBlock>

### Prompter LLM

A workflow that uses a prompt template with LLM.
<CodeBlock className="language-text">{CodeOutputPrompterYaml}</CodeBlock>


### RAG Prompter LLM

This workflow uses LLM with a RAG prompter template.
<CodeBlock className="language-text">{CodeOutputRAGYaml}</CodeBlock>

## Delete workflows

The Clarifai Python SDK empowers users to seamlessly delete workflows through the API by specifying the unique identifier of the workflow. This functionality provides a straightforward method for users to manage and remove workflows as needed within their applications or projects. By utilizing the provided workflow id parameter, developers can efficiently interact with the Clarifai platform to streamline workflow management processes.
