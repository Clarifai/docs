# Advanced Model Operations
**Learn how to perform advanced model operations using Clarifai Python SDK**
<hr />

The Clarifai Python SDK offers advanced operations on models that will satisfy various use cases. Two such features offered are Model Upload & Model Export. These features empower users to establish a robust machine learning workflow entirely within the Clarifai ecosystem. 

Model Upload allows you to seamlessly integrate your custom-trained models in triton format onto the Clarifai platform. Model Export grants users the flexibility to export trained models from Clarifai, enabling them to be deployed in environments outside of the Clarifai platform. 
This expands the potential use cases for Clarifai models, allowing them to be integrated into custom applications or pipelines that require more control or specific hardware configurations.
