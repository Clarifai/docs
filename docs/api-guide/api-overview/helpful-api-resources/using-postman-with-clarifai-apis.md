# Using Postman with Clarifai APIs

## **Introduction**

This page explains how to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to perform some API calls to Clarifai by showing the actions available within the Clarifai platform. You can use Postman to make a wide variety of `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` calls.

With Postman, you can use, hit, or test the Clarifai API without the need to use the Portal or call the endpoints programmatically. Postman also allows you to make API calls and generate code snippets in your favorite programming language. You can use the snippets to make REST requests to the Clarifai API.

This page will hopefully get you set up and somewhat familiar with using Postman to make requests to the Clarifai platform. After learning how to use Postman to make calls to Clarifai, you can make other requests by referring to the REST examples throughout this documentation.
