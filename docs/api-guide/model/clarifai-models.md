# Clarifai Models

**Pre-built, pre-trained, pre-optimized models that work right out of the box**
<hr />

Our model library is constantly growing and developing. To learn more about the available models, you can:

- browse our expansive [model gallery](https://clarifai.com/explore/models); 
- or use the ["Get"](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/model/create-get-update-and-delete#get) commands outlined in the API Guide.

## Pre-Built Clarifai Models

Clarifai models are "trainable" machine learning models that have been developed in-house and have been thoroughly tested.

Clarifai models are ready to make predictions right out of the box. 

For example, our [`general-image-recognition`](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/general-image-recognition) model recognizes over 10,000 different concepts, including objects, themes, moods, and more, with outputs in 23 different languages. 
Our [`food-item-recognition`](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/food-item-recognition) model recognizes more than 1,000 food items in images, down to the ingredient level. 

So, before you train your own model, we suggest trying out any of our state-of-the-art models to see if any fits your needs.

## Agent System Operator Models

Agent system operator models are "non-trainable", or "fixed function" models that help you connect, route, and control the inputs and outputs that you send through your [workflows](https://docs.clarifai.com/api-guide/workflows/). Operator models are critical building blocks for creating more advanced workflows.
