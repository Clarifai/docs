**Search for people, places, objects, and topics in your unstructured data**
<hr />


AI models can be used to power search. Our API automatically indexes your inputs so that they are ready for search from the moment they are uploaded. Once indexed, you can search for inputs by concept, visual similarity, metadata, or any other criteria.

With our advanced transfer learning technology, your model can learn new concepts in seconds or minutes. Then, Clarifai's state-of-the-art patented search technology can be used to search for this concept immediately, without the need for reindexing.
