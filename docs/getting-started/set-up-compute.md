# Set Up Compute Fast

**Set up your computing infrastructure easily and fast for inference**
<hr />

Clarifai offers an intuitive user interface and a robust API that allow you to quickly provision your own computing infrastructure — making the process of deploying your models easier and faster.

Alternatively, you can initiate your first deployment by navigating to the **Set Up Compute** section on the homepage. Then, choose either the **Basic Compute** or **Advanced Compute** option, as outlined earlier, to apply your pre-configured compute orchestration settings. If these predefined options don’t fully meet your requirements, you can select the **Create your own** option to customize the infrastructure according to your specific needs._

Once you’ve selected a pre-configured option, a confirmation window will appear, displaying your chosen compute settings. A Personal Access Token (PAT) will be pre-populated for your convenience. If needed, you can select a different token from the dropdown list or create a new one._

After confirming your settings, click the **Create** button. This will automatically generate a compute cluster and nodepool based on your pre-configured settings._

 _Next, choose the model you wish to deploy and click the **Deploy Model** button. You’ll then be redirected to the nodepool page, where your compute settings and deployed model will be displayed for reference, as outlined earlier._
