# Toolkits

**Download and run AI models locally with Clarifai toolkits**
<hr />

Toolkits let you run large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI models locally on your machine. They provide a standardized way to initialize a new Clarifai model directory structure thatâ€™s fully compatible with the Clarifai platform.

Using toolkits, you can easily download and set up models from popular repositories such as Hugging Face or Ollama, making it simple to prepare them for deployment or integration with Clarifai.

To download and initialize a model using a toolkit we support, run:

```bash
clarifai model init --toolkit <toolkit-name>
```


import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
