# Providers
**Make inferences with Clarifai using an OpenAI-compatible format**
<hr />

Clarifai supports various providers that you can use to interact with different models. We offer an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, allowing any OpenAI-compatible library or client to seamlessly send requests directly to Clarifai.

:::info

Base URL for Clarifai's OpenAI endpoint: `https://api.clarifai.com/v2/ext/openai/v1`.

:::

This integration capability offers several advantages, including:

- **Access to diverse models** — Harness Clarifai's rich array of models directly within your OpenAI projects, expanding your AI capabilities.
- **Standardized interaction** — Interact with Clarifai-hosted models using familiar OpenAI API patterns and interfaces, reducing the learning curve and streamlining development.
- **Enhanced flexibility** — Leverage the power of Clarifai's platform while maintaining the flexibility of your chosen OpenAI development environment.

:::note

Usage-based billing is handled directly through Clarifai — not through OpenAI or any other provider. Also, while most OpenAI parameters are supported, certain advanced features may be unavailable depending on the specific model or endpoint.
