The Clarifai Python SDK allows you to upload custom models easily. Whether you're working with a pre-trained model from an external source like Hugging Face, or one you've built from scratch, Clarifai allows seamless integration of your models, enabling you to take advantage of the platform’s powerful capabilities.

Once imported to our platform, your model can be utilized alongside Clarifai's vast suite of AI tools. It will be automatically deployed and ready to be evaluated, combined with other models and agent operators in a workflow, or used to serve inference requests as it is.

:::info Objective

Let’s walk through how to build and upload a custom model to the Clarifai platform. This example model appends the phrase `Hello World` to any input text and also supports streaming responses.

## Step 1: Perform Prerequisites

### Sign Up or Log In 

[Log in to](https://clarifai.com/login) your existing Clarifai account, or [sign up](https://clarifai.com/signup) for a new one. If you're creating a new account, a default application will be provided for you.

Next, retrieve the following credentials:

- **App ID** – Go to your application’s page and select the [**Overview**](https://docs.clarifai.com/create/applications/manage#app-overview) option in the collapsible left sidebar. Get the app ID from there. 
- **User ID** – In the collapsible left sidebar, select **Settings** and choose **Account** from the dropdown list. Then, locate your user ID.
- **Personal Access Token (PAT)** – From the same **Settings** option, choose **Secrets** to generate or copy your [PAT](https://docs.clarifai.com/control/authentication/pat). This token is used to authenticate your connection with the Clarifai platform.

You need to set the `CLARIFAI_PAT` you've retrieved as an environment variable to enhance its security. 

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="Unix-Like Systems">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash"> export CLARIFAI_PAT=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE </CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bash2" label="Windows">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash"> set CLARIFAI_PAT=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE </CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Install Clarifai Package

Install the latest version of the `clarifai` Python package. This will also install the Clarifai [Command Line Interface](https://docs.clarifai.com/additional-resources/api-overview/cli/) (CLI), which we'll use for testing and uploading the model. 


<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash"> pip install --upgrade clarifai </CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Set up Docker or a Virtual Environment

To test, run, and upload your model, you need to set up either a Docker container or a Python virtual environment. This ensures proper dependency management and prevents conflicts in your project.  

Both options allow you to work with different Python versions. For example, you can use Python 3.11 for uploading one model and Python 3.12 for another — configured via the [`config.yaml`](#build-info) file.  

> If Docker is installed on your system, it is highly recommended to use it for running the model. Docker provides better isolation and a fully portable environment, including for Python and system libraries.   
 
You should ensure your local environment has sufficient memory and compute resources to handle model loading and execution, especially during [testing](https://docs.clarifai.com/sdk/compute-orchestration/test-models-locally).  

### Create Project Directory

:::tip

You can automatically generate the required files by running the [`clarifai model init`](https://docs.clarifai.com/resources/api-overview/cli#clarifai-model-init) command in the terminal from your current directory. After the files are created, you can modify them as needed.

:::

Create a project directory and organize your files as indicated below to fit the requirements of uploading models to the Clarifai platform. 

```text
your_model_directory/
├── 1/
│   └── model.py
├── requirements.txt
└── config.yaml
```

- **your_model_directory/** – The root directory containing all files related to your custom model.
  - **1/** – A subdirectory that holds the model file (_Note that the folder is named as **1**_).
    - **model.py** – Contains the code that defines your model, including loading the model and running inference.
  - **requirements.txt** – Lists the Python dependencies required to run your model.
  - **config.yaml** – Contains model metadata and configuration details necessary for building the model, defining compute resources, and more.

## Step 2: Build a Model

Let's talk about the general steps you'd follow to upload any type of model to the Clarifai platform. 

### Prepare `model.py` 

The `model.py` file contains the core logic for your model, including how the model is loaded and how predictions are made. This file must define a custom class that inherits from `ModelClass` and implements the required methods.

This is the `model.py` file for the custom model we want to upload:

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock className="language-python"> {PrepareModelPyFile} </CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let’s break down what each part of the file does.

#### a. `load_model` Method 

The `load_model` method is optional but recommended, as it prepares the model for inference by handling resource-heavy initializations. It is particularly useful for:

- One-time setup of heavy resources, such as loading trained models or initializing data transformations.
- Executing tasks during model container startup to reduce runtime latency.
- Loading essential components like tokenizers, pipelines, and other model-related assets.

Here is an example:

```python
def load_model(self):
  self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("model/")
  self.pipeline = transformers.pipeline(...)
```

#### b. Prediction Methods 

The `model.py` file must include at least one method decorated with `@ModelClass.method` to define the prediction endpoints.

In the example model we want to upload, we defined a method that appends the phrase `Hello World` to any input text and added support for different types of [streaming responses](#step-6-predict-with-model).

> **Note:** The structure of prediction methods on the client side directly mirrors the method signatures defined in your `model.py` file. This one-to-one mapping provides flexibility in defining prediction methods with varying names and arguments.

> Here are some examples of method mapping:

> | `model.py` Model Implementation                 | Client-Side Usage Pattern |
> |-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
> | `@ModelClass.method def predict(...)`           | `model.predict(...)`     |
> | `@ModelClass.method def generate(...)`          | `model.generate(...)`    |
> | `@ModelClass.method def stream(...)`            | `model.stream(...)`      |

> You can learn more about the structure of prediction methods [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/models/inference/#structure-of-prediction-methods). 


:::warning [Supported Input and Output Data Types](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/models/model-upload/data-types/)

Each parameter in the class methods must be annotated with a type, and the return type must also be specified. Clarifai's model framework supports rich data typing for both inputs and outputs. Supported types include `Text`, `Image`, `Audio`, `Video`, and more.

:::

### Prepare `config.yaml` 

The `config.yaml` file is essential for specifying the model’s metadata, compute resource requirements, and model checkpoints. 

This is the `config.yaml` file for the custom model we want to upload:

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
    <CodeBlock className="language-yaml">{ConfigModelInfo}</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let’s break down what each part of the file does.

#### Model Info  

This section defines your unique model ID (any arbitrary name you choose), along with the Clarifai user ID and app ID you retrieved [earlier](#sign-up-or-log-in). These values will determine where the model is uploaded on the Clarifai platform.

#### Build Info  

This section specifies details about the environment used to build or run the model. You can include the `python_version`, which is useful for ensuring compatibility between the model and its runtime environment, as different Python versions may have varying dependencies, library support, and performance characteristics.

:::note

We currently support Python 3.11 and Python 3.12 (default).

:::

#### Compute Resources  

You must define the minimum compute resources required for running your model, including CPU, memory, and optional GPU specifications.

These are some parameters you can define:

- **`cpu_limit`** – Number of CPUs allocated for the model (follows [Kubernetes notation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/quantity/), e.g., "1", "2").
- **`cpu_requests`** (default: `500m` (500 millicores)) – Specifies the minimum amount of CPU resources to request. Follows Kubernetes notation (e.g., "100m", "1", "4.5"), where 1 equals one full CPU core.
- **`cpu_memory`** – Minimum memory required for the CPU (uses Kubernetes notation, e.g., "1Gi", "1500Mi", "3Gi").
-	**`cpu_memory_requests`** (default: `500Mi` (500 mebibytes)) – Specifies the minimum amount of memory to request for the CPU. Also follows Kubernetes notation, such as 1Ki (1 kibibyte), 1500Mi (1500 mebibytes), 3Gi(3 gibibytes), and 4Ti (4 tebibytes).
- **`num_accelerators`** – Number of GPUs or TPUs to use for inference.
- **`accelerator_type`** – Specifies the type of hardware [accelerators](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/deployments/cloud-instances/) (e.g., GPU or TPU) supported by the model (e.g., "NVIDIA-A10G"). _Note that instead of specifying an exact accelerator type, you can use a wildcard `(*)` to automatically match all available accelerators that fit your use case. For example, using `["NVIDIA-*"]` will enable the system to choose from all NVIDIA options compatible with your model._
- **`accelerator_memory`** – Minimum memory required for the GPU or TPU.

#### Hugging Face Model Checkpoints  

If you're using a model from Hugging Face, you can automatically download its checkpoints by specifying the appropriate configuration in this section. 

For private or restricted Hugging Face repositories, make sure to include an access token. Learn how to generate one [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).

See the [additional examples](#additional-examples) below for how to define Hugging Face checkpoints.

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
    <CodeBlock className="language-yaml">{HFCheckpoints}</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note

The `when` parameter in the `checkpoints` section determines when model checkpoints should be downloaded and stored. It must be set to one of the following options:  

- `runtime` (_default_) – Downloads checkpoints when loading the model in the `load_model` method.  
- `build` – Downloads checkpoints during the image build process.  
- `upload` – Downloads checkpoints before uploading the model.  

For larger models, we highly recommend downloading checkpoints at `runtime`. Doing so prevents unnecessary increases in Docker image size, which has some advantages:  

- Smaller image sizes
- Faster build times
- Quicker uploads and inference on the Clarifai platform

Downloading checkpoints at `build` or `upload` time can significantly increase image size, resulting in longer upload times and increased cold start latency.

:::

#### Model Concepts or Labels

This section is required if your model outputs concepts or labels and is not being directly loaded from Hugging Face. So, you must define a `concepts` section in the `config.yaml` file. 

The following model types output concepts or labels:

- `visual-classifier`
- `visual-detector`
- `visual-segmenter`
- `text-classifier` 

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
    <CodeBlock className="language-yaml">{ModelConcepts}</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note 

If you're using a model from Hugging Face and the `checkpoints` section is defined, the Clarifai platform will automatically infer concepts. In this case, you don’t need to manually specify them.

:::

### Prepare `requirements.txt`

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the Python dependencies your model needs. 

This is the `requirements.txt` file for the custom model we want to upload:

```text
clarifai>=11.8.2
```

If your model requires Torch, we provide optimized pre-built Torch images as the base for machine learning and inference tasks.

These images include all necessary dependencies, ensuring efficient execution. The available pre-built Torch images are:

- `2.4.1-py3.11-cuda124` — Based on PyTorch 2.4.1, Python 3.11, and CUDA 12.4.
- `2.5.1-py3.11-cuda124` — Based on PyTorch 2.5.1, Python 3.11, and CUDA 12.4.
- `2.4.1-py3.12-cuda124` — Based on PyTorch 2.4.1, Python 3.12, and CUDA 12.4.
- `2.5.1-py3.12-cuda124` — Based on PyTorch 2.5.1, Python 3.12, and CUDA 12.4.

To use a specific Torch version, define it in your requirements.txt file like this:

```text
torch==2.5.1
```

This ensures the correct pre-built image is pulled from Clarifai's container registry, ensuring the correct environment is used. This minimizes cold start times and speeds up model uploads and runtime execution — avoiding the overhead of building images from scratch or pulling and configuring them from external sources.

We recommend using either `torch==2.5.1` or `torch==2.4.1`. If your model requires a different Torch version, you can specify it in requirements.txt, but this may slightly increase the model upload time.

## Step 3: Test the Model Locally

Before uploading your model to the Clarifai platform, it's important to test it locally to catch any typos or misconfigurations in the code. 

Learn how to  run and test your models locally [here](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/local-runners/). 

## Step 4: Upload the Model to Clarifai

Once your model is ready, you can upload it to the platform using Clarifai CLI.  

To upload your model, run the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash"> clarifai model upload ./your/model/path/here </CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, navigate to the directory containing your custom model and run the command without specifying the directory path:

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash"> clarifai model upload </CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command builds the model’s Docker image using the defined compute resources and uploads it to Clarifai, where it can be served in production. 
The build logs will be displayed in your terminal, which helps you troubleshoot any upload issues.

> **Note**: If you make any changes to your model and upload it again to the Clarifai platform, a new version of the model will be created automatically.

:::note Skip Dockerfile

By default, when you upload a model, the CLI automatically generates a `Dockerfile` in the root of your model directory. This ensures your model can be built and deployed with the correct environment. 

In some cases, though, you may prefer to provide your own custom [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/), such as when a specific base image is required for model inference.

To do this, use the `--skip_dockerfile` flag. This tells the CLI to skip automatic Dockerfile generation and instead rely on the one you’ve created.

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">clarifai model upload --skip_dockerfile</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>Automatically Generated Dockerfile Example</summary>
    <CodeBlock className="language-dockerfile">{DockerFile}</CodeBlock>
</details>

:::

## Step 5: Deploy the Model

After you've successfully uploaded your model to the Clarifai platform, the terminal will guide you through the deployment process, getting your model ready for inference. 

You can follow the prompts to:

* **[Set up a cluster](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/deployments/clusters-nodepools)** – This serves as the overarching computational environment.
* **Create a nodepool** – A nodepool is a group of compute nodes within your cluster that provides the resources needed to run your model.
* **[Deploy your model](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/deployments/deploy-model)** – Once your nodepool is set up, you can deploy your model, making it available to process prediction requests.
