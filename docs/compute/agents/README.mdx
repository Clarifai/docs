# Agents
**Build powerful AI agents with Clarifai**
<hr />

Artificial intelligence (AI) agents refer to autonomous systems that often leverage large language models (LLMs) as their core. Given high-level instructions, these agents possess the remarkable ability to understand, plan, reason, and execute complex tasks to achieve specific goals.

They go beyond simple automation by demonstrating:

- **Intelligent planning** — Breaking down ambiguous instructions into actionable steps.
- **Tools utilization** — A tool equips an agent with specific capabilities, enabling it to perform actions and interact with the external world beyond its inherent text generation and reasoning. _What sets effective agents apart from basic language models is their ability to properly use tools._
- **Adaptability & learning** — Learning from interactions, maintaining context, and improving performance over time.
- **Collaboration** — Working with other agents to achieve complex, multi-faceted outcomes.
