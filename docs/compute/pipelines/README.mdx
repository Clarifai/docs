# Pipelines
**Orchestrate asynchronous, long-running, multi-step AI processes**
<hr />

Clarifai Pipelines let you design and run asynchronous, long-running, multi-step processes for complex AI and MLOps tasks. They act as the orchestration backbone for building advanced AI agents and managing end-to-end machine learning operations.

Pipelines enable you to define, execute, and monitor container-based jobs directly on the Clarifai platform, giving you fine-grained control over each step.

With Clarifai Pipelines, you get a scalable, end-to-end automation engine that simplifies and unifies your entire MLOps lifecycle.

## Use Cases for Pipelines

Clarifai Pipelines support a wide range of AI and MLOps workflows. Here are some common use cases:

* **Automated MLOps workflows** — Build reliable, repeatable pipelines for data preparation, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Pipelines integrate seamlessly with version control and CI/CD systems to support continuous experimentation and delivery.

* **AI agent orchestration** —  Design, test, and deploy advanced AI agents that execute multi-step logic autonomously. Pipelines orchestrate [tool usage](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/inference/open-ai/#tool-calling), LLM calls, and decision logic while managing state, external APIs, and long-running tasks that can execute for hours or even days.

* **Asynchronous, long-running application tasks** — Add powerful backend capabilities to your applications without operational complexity. Pipelines make it easy to trigger and monitor tasks like large-scale batch processing, model fine-tuning, or complex data transformations.

* **Complex workflow automation** — Orchestrate sophisticated, multi-stage AI workflows across multiple components and services. Pipelines provide built-in support for state management, fault tolerance, and scalable execution across distributed systems.

## Quick Start

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";


You can follow these steps to quickly get started with pipelines via the API. 

### Get Credentials

**1.** Go to the Clarifai platform and get your user ID, [app ID](https://docs.clarifai.com/create/applications/manage#app-overview), and Personal Access Token [(PAT)](https://docs.clarifai.com/control/authentication/pat). 

Then, set your PAT as an environment variable:

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="Unix-Like Systems">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">export CLARIFAI_PAT=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bash2" label="Windows">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">set CLARIFAI_PAT=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**2.** You’ll also need to create a [compute cluster and nodepool](https://docs.clarifai.com/getting-started/set-up-compute) and get their IDs. 

### Initialize a Pipeline Project

Run the following command to create a new pipeline project in your current directory. Follow the prompts to provide the required details.

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="CLI">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">clarifai pipeline init</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Upload the Pipeline

Run the following command to upload the pipeline with associated pipeline steps to Clarifai.

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="CLI">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">clarifai pipeline upload</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Run the Pipeline

Run the following command to start the pipeline and monitor its progress until completion or timeout.

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="bash" label="CLI">
    ```text
    clarifai pipeline run --compute_cluster_id cluster_id_here --nodepool_id nodepool_id_here
    ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
