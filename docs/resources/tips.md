## Webhook Integration

You can enable real-time automation by integrating Clarifai webhooks into your backend system. For example, you can set up a secure Flask endpoint to receive and validate webhook notifications for events like model training completion or new input uploads.

## Caching Predictions

You can avoid repeated computation for identical inputs by caching model predictions locally. For example, you can introduce a simple decorator-based caching mechanism  to store and retrieve results from disk, which optimizes performance for resource-intensive prediction tasks.
