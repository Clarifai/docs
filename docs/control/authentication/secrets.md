# Secrets

** **
<hr />

A secret in the Clarifai platform is any piece of confidential information that allows users to securely store and manage sensitive values, such as API keys, credentials, or third-party tokens. 

After creating a secret, you can reference it in various operations at runtime without exposing it in code or logs. Secrets are injected as environment variables into your runtime during execution.



While the most common use case is passing API keys to models, a secret can represent any confidential information that your AI system needs.
