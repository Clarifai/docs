# Authentication

**Secure, compliant AI**
<hr />

Authentication ensures secure access to the Clarifai platform. You can log in with your username and password through the web interface or use Google or GitHub single-sign-on (SSO). 

> **Note:** The length of a login session depends on how you sign in: SSO sessions remain active for seven days. When using a regular username and password, selecting “remember me” extends the session to 30 days, while logging in without it limits the session to just one day.

For API and SDK interactions, authentication is handled using a Personal Access Token (PAT) or API Key, which provide secure access without sharing your password.

This section walks you through the available authentication methods, how to set them up, and best practices for keeping your credentials safe.
