# Account and Billing 

**View and manage your personal account and billing settings**

<hr />

The **Account** and **Billing** pages serve as your central hub for managing every aspect of your profile and subscription. 

These pages give you full control over your account by allowing you to customize your personal information and handle billing-related activities.

## Account

The **Account** page allows you to view and manage your personal identity and security preferences on the Clarifai platform.

To access it, [log in](https://clarifai.com/login) to the Clarifai platform. Then, in the collapsible left sidebar, select **Settings** and choose **Account** from the dropdown list.

### Profile Information

This section displays the personal and professional details you provided when creating your account.

You can customize how you appear across the Community platform — such as on shared model or app pages — by uploading a profile avatar. If no image is uploaded, your initials will be shown instead.

To upload or change your avatar, click **Change Avatar**. A pop-up will appear, allowing you to select an image from your device.

> **Note:** The image must be in JPEG or PNG format and no larger than **20MB**.

You can also update any of your profile details in this section. After making changes, click **Update User Info** to save them.

### Profile

![ ](/img/new-docs/account_2.png)

This section displays your unique User ID, which serves as your username handle across the platform — appearing in both API references and platform URLs.

Your User ID is not case-sensitive and may include one or more alphanumeric strings separated by hyphens or underscores.

To update it, click the **Edit** button next to the field. A pop-up will appear, allowing you to enter a new User ID.

> **Caution:** Changing your User ID may lead to unintended side effects, as we do not create redirects for old app URLs and we do not re-route requests that reference your previous User ID. If you make this change, you are responsible for notifying any collaborators who may be affected.

### Email

This section lists and manages all email addresses associated with your account and indicates which one is set as your **Primary** contact. 

To link an additional email address, enter it into the **Add new email** field and click **Add Email**.


### Danger Zone

This section contains actions that have significant and potentially irreversible effects on your account.

To manage your user profile visibility, click **Update Visibility** and choose whether your profile should be public (visible to everyone) or private.

To permanently remove your account, click **Delete Account**. This action is irreversible and will permanently erase all data associated with your profile. Proceed with extreme caution when using this option.


## Billing

The **Subscription & Billing** page provides a centralized place to view and manage your plan, payment methods, and invoices.

To access it, [log in](https://clarifai.com/login) to the Clarifai platform. Then, in the collapsible left sidebar, select **Settings** and choose **Billing** from the dropdown list.

On this page, you will see details of your current subscription plan along with options to upgrade or switch to other plans. Each plan card includes a brief summary of the tier — such as monthly pricing, spending limits, and links to additional information.

> **Note:** The monthly spending limits are $100 for Developer and Essential plans, and $500 for the Professional plan. You can [contact us](https://www.clarifai.com/explore/contact-us) if you require higher limits

In the **Payment Methods** section, you can add a new payment option by clicking **Add a Credit Card**. A pop-up window will appear, allowing you to securely enter your card details.

> **Note:** We have a new credit card pre-authorization process. A temporary charge of $50 for Developer, $100 for Essential, and $500 for Professional plans is applied to verify card validity and available funds. The amount is automatically refunded within seven days

The **Invoices** section provides a complete history of your billing activity, displaying past transactions and downloadable statements for your records.
