# Clarifai Organizations

**Consolidate multiple accounts and enhance collaboration**
<hr />


Clarifai Organization, commonly referred to as the Org feature,  is a functionality within our platform that lets you consolidate multiple Clarifai accounts into an organization, allowing you to enhance collaboration and drive better results with your AI-powered software solutions. 

With the Org feature, you can create and centrally manage your company’s machine learning projects. It allows you to consolidate your team’s capabilities so that you can realize the compliance, security, and budgetary goals of your enterprise.

## Capabilities of Organizations

The Org feature offers the following capabilities:

- **Centralize management of your Clarifai operations** — An Organization enables you to bring your collaborators, teams, applications, and other resources within Clarifai under a single umbrella. For example, if you’re an administrator of an organization, you can invite existing Clarifai users to be members of your organization, which allows you to manage their accounts from a central point. 
This centralized control makes it easy to track your usage of the Clarifai platform and get the most out of it. 

- **Consolidate billing for all members of an organization** — A Clarifai Organization lets you consolidate the billing for all member accounts so that you can conveniently track and pay for each account. Having one bill across your organization allows you to monitor the charges across multiple accounts and optimize the cost performance of your organization.

- **Enact access policies** — As an administrator, you can set up policies that dictate how users can access the resources within your organization. You can also enact role-based security to restrict access to resources based on a member’s privileges within the organization. You can allow members to access only the applications necessary to perform their assigned duties effectively.

- **Set up siloed access permissions** — As an administrator, you can set up various teams and attach different access permissions to them. You can specify which applications and individual actions the users in each team can access. 
For example, if you have members within your organization who must access only the resources that meet certain data regulatory requirements, you can aggregate those accounts in their own team. You then define a policy that prevents members of that team from accessing resources that do not comply with those regulatory standards.
