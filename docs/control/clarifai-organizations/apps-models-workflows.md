# Apps, Models, Workflows, & Compute

**Create and manage apps, models, workflows, and dedicated compute**

<hr />

In a Clarifai organization, you have the ability to create and manage various resources, such as [apps](https://docs.clarifai.com/create/applications/), [models](https://docs.clarifai.com/create/models/), [workflows](https://docs.clarifai.com/create/workflows/), and even set up [dedicated compute](https://docs.clarifai.com/compute/deployments/clusters-nodepools) for deploying models. The process for handling these resources is consistent with how they are managed across the rest of our platform. 

This ensures a seamless experience whether you are working within an organization or individual account.

You can visit the respective sections within this documentation to understand how to effectively create and manage these resources. This will help you make the most of the Org feature and enhance collaboration within your teams. 

## Transfer an App 

You can transfer an app you own to an organization you belong to, provided you have the necessary [permissions](https://docs.clarifai.com/portal-guide/clarifai-organizations/security#scopes-and-access-levels-of-organization-members) to create apps. This transfer enhances collaboration and boosts productivity within your team.

To do so, on your personal workspace, click the **Projects** option in the navigation bar. This will take you to a page showing all the apps you own. From there, select the app you want to transfer to an organization.

You’ll be redirected to the app’s individual page. Select the **Settings** option on the collapsible left sidebar.

On the **App Settings** page, scroll down to the **Transfer ownership** section and click the **Transfer** button.

On the dialog box that appears, select the app’s destination organization and give it a new name, if you want to. 

Click the **Confirm** button to finalize the transfer.

The app will be successfully moved to the organization you selected, and it will no longer appear on your listed apps page.
