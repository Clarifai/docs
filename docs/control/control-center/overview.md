# Overview Tab

**Get a summary of your key metrics at a glance**
<hr />

The Overview tab allows you to quickly access the charts and data you choose from other function-specific tabs within the Control Center. 

To access it, select **Control Center** in the collapsible left sidebar and choose **Overview** from the dropdown list. You can look at the section to get a quick summary of the activities you undertook.

## Date Range Selection

You can use the date range control to filter and view data for specific time periods. The feature allows you to select a range as a criterion to view the output of the Overview section.

:::info upgrade your plan

You can still use the Control Center to track your metrics for a specified date range even if you are a free user. Consider upgrading to the paid plan to unlock extra platform capabilities and keep tracking them here. 

:::

To select a date range, click the button in the upper-right corner of the page. A small window will drop down, which allows you to select your preferred date range.

By default, the display of data is filtered based on your current month-to-month billing cycle. You can customize the output by selecting a predefined date range — from today to the last 6 months.

You can also use the date picker button at the bottom of the drop-down window to select a custom date range.

## Charts

The Overview section includes charts that visually represent data for easy analysis. Once you pin a chart from other tabs within the Control Center, it will automatically appear in the Overview. 

> **Tip:** You can also click the **Pin to overview page** button directly within the Overview to quickly add the suggested chart to the section.

In the [next section](./usage/#common-chart-features), we’ll explore charts in more detail and walk you through how to add them to the Overview.

:::note drag and remove charts

> - You can easily drag charts up and down within the Overview section by clicking and holding the dots in the upper-left corner.

> - You can also remove a chart from the section by simply clicking the delete button (X) in the upper-right corner. This action will only remove the chart from the Overview section, without deleting it from the respective data section of the Control Center.
