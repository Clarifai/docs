# Control Center

**A unified interface for centralized visibility into your platform usage**
<hr />

Clarifai Control Center is a unified dashboard, a single pane of glass to monitor everything happening within your account in our platform. It serves as the sole source of truth for various information dimensions, enabling you to make informed decisions based on data from different sources. 

The Control Center is organized into multiple tabs and offers a versatile and intuitive way to explore specific details.

The key functionalities include charts of different types, tables, date ranges, as well as filtering and sorting options. In the future, we plan to expand it to include smart widgets, alerts, comparison modules, raw data export, and more.
