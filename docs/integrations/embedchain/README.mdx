**Learn how to use Clarifai models in Embedchain**
<hr />

[Embedchain](https://embedchain.ai/) is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with custom knowledge bases. This framework allows users to create bots that can answer questions based on the content added to them. It aims to make the process of embedding data and using it with LLMs straightforward and efficient. By integrating it with Clarifai, users can now use LLMs and embedders from the Clarifai Platform for their tasks.
